<h2><a name="In_Defence_of_Bad_Taste" id="In_Defence_of_Bad_Taste"></a>In Defence of Bad Taste</h2>


<p>In America, where men are supposed to know
nothing about matters of taste and where
women have their dresses planned for them,
the household decorator has become an important
factor in domestic life. Out of an even hundred
rich men how many can say that they have had
anything to do with the selection or arrangement
of the furnishings for their homes? In theatre
programs these matters are regulated and due
credit is given to the various firms who have supplied
the myriad appeals to the eye; one knows
who thought out the combinations of shoes, hats,
and parasols, and one knows where each separate
article was purchased. Why could not some
similar plan of appreciation be followed in the
houses of our very rich? Why not, for instance,
a card in the hall something like the following:</p>

<p>
<i>This house was furnished and decorated according<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to the taste of Marcel of the Dilly-Billy Shop</span></i><br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
<i>We are living in the kind of house Miss Simone<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O'Kelly thought we should live in. The</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">decorations are pure Louis XV and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">the furniture is authentic.</span></i><br />
</p>

<p>It is not difficult, of course, to differentiate the
personal from the impersonal. Nothing clings so
ill to the back as borrowed finery and I have yet
to find the family which has settled itself fondly
and comfortably in chairs which were a part of
some one else's aesthetic plan. As a matter of fact
many of our millionaires would be more at home
in an atmosphere concocted from the ingredients
of plain pine tables and blanket-covered mattresses
than they are surrounded by the frippery of China
and the frivolity of France. If these gentlemen
were fortunate enough to enjoy sufficient confidence
in their own taste to give it a thorough test
it is not safe to think of the extreme burden that
would be put on the working capacity of the factories
of the Grand Rapids furniture companies.
We might find a few emancipated souls scouring
the town for heavy refectory tables and divans into
which one could sink, reclining or upright, with
a perfect sense of ease, but these would be as rare
as Steinway pianos in Coney Island.</p>

<p>For Americans are meek in such matters. They
credit themselves with no taste. They fear comparison.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
If the very much sought-after Simone
O'Kelly has decorated Mr. B.'s house Mr. M.
does not dare to struggle along with merely his
own ideas in furnishing his. He calls in an expert
who begins, rather inauspiciously, by painting
the dining-room salmon pink. The tables and
chairs will be made by somebody on Tenth Street,
exact copies of a set to be found in the Mus&eacute;e
Carnavalet. The legs under the table are awkwardly
arranged for diners but they look very
well when the table is unclothed. The decorator
plans to hang Mr. M.'s personal bedroom in pale
plum colour. Mr. M. rebels at this. "I detest,"
he remarks mildly, "all variants of purple."
"Very well," acquiesces the decorator, "we
will make it green." In the end Mr. M.'s worst
premonitions are realized: the walls are resplendent
in a striking shade of magenta. Along the edge
of each panel of Chinese brocade a narrow band
of absinthe velvet ribbon gives the necessary contrast.
The furniture is painted in dull ivory with
touches of gold and beryl and the bed cover is
peacock blue. Four round cushions of a similar
shade repose on the floor at the foot of the bed.
The fat manufacturer's wife as she enters this
triumph of decoration which might satisfy Louise
de la Valli&egrave;re or please Doris Keane, is an <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>anachronistic
figure and she is aware of it. She prefers,
on the whole, the brass bedsteads of the
summer hotels. Mr. M. himself feels ridiculous.
He never enters the room without a groan and a
remark on the order of "Good God, what a
colour!" His personal taste finds its supreme enjoyment
in the Circassian walnut panelling, desk,
and tables of the directors' room in the Millionaire's
Trust and Savings Bank. "Rich and tasteful":
how many times he has used this phrase to
express his approval! In the mid-Victorian red
plush of his club, too, he is comfortable.
"Waiter, another whiskey and soda!"</p>

<p>Mildred is expected home after her first year
in boarding school. Her mother wishes to environ
her, so to speak. Mildred is delicate in her tastes,
so delicate that she scarcely ever expresses herself.
Her mind and body are pure; her heart
beats faster when she learns of distress. Voluptuousness,
Venus, and Vice are all merely words to
her. Mother does not explain this to the decorator.
"My daughter is returning from school,"
she says, "I want her room done." "What style
of room?" "After all you are supposed to know
that. I am engaging you to arrange it for me."
"Your daughter, I take it, is a modern girl?"
"You may assume as much." In despair for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
hint the decorator steals a look at a photograph
of the miss, full-lipped, melting dark eyes, and
blue-black hair. Sensing an houri he hangs the
walls with a deep shade of Persian orange, over
which flit tropical birds of emerald and azure;
strange pomegranates bleed their seeds at regular
intervals. The couch is an adaptation, in colour,
of the celebrated <i>Sumurun</i> bed. The dressing
table and the <i>chaise-longue</i> are of Chinese lacquer.
A heavy bronze incense burner pours forth fumes
of Bichara's <i>Scheherazade</i>. From the window
frames, stifling the light, depend flame-coloured
brocaded curtains embroidered in Egyptian
enamelled beads. It is a triumph, this chamber,
of <i>style Ballet Russe</i>. Diana is banished ...
and shrinking Mildred, returning from school,
finds her demure soul at variance with her surroundings.</p>

<p>A man's house should be the expression of the
man himself. All the books on the subject and
even the household decorators themselves will tell
you that. But, if the decoration of a house is to
express its owner, it is necessary that he himself
inspire it, which implies, of course, the possession
of ideas, even though they be bad. And men in
these United States are not expected to display
mental anguish or pleasure when confronted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
colour combinations. In America one is constantly
hearing young ladies say, "He's a man
and so, of course, knows nothing about colour,"
or "Of course a man never looks at clothes." It
does not seem to be necessary to argue this point.
One has only to remember that Veronese was a
man; so was Velasquez. Even Paul Poiret and
Leon Bakst belong to the sex of Adam. Nevertheless
most Americans still consider it a little
<i>eff&eacute;min&eacute;</i>, a trifle <i>declass&eacute;</i>, for a business man (allowances
are sometimes made for poets, musicians,
actors, and people who live in Greenwich Village),
to make any references to colour or form. He
may admire, with obvious emphasis on the women
they lightly enclose, the costumes of the <i>Follies</i>
but he is not permitted to exhibit knowledge of
materials and any suddenly expressed desire on
his part to rush into a shop and hug some bit of
colour from the show window to his heart would be
regarded as a symptom of madness.</p>

<p>The audience which gives the final verdict on
a farce makes allowances for the author; permits
him the use of certain conventions. For example,
he is given leave to introduce a hotel corridor into
his last act with seven doors opening on a common
hallway so that his characters may conveniently
and persistently enter the wrong rooms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
It may be supposed that I ask for some such license
from my audience. "How ridiculous," you may
be saying, "I know of interior decorators who
spend weeks in reading out the secrets of their
clients' souls in order to provide their proper
settings." There doubtless are interior decorators
who succeed in giving a home the appearance
of a well-kept hotel where guests may mingle comfortably
and freely. I should not wish to deny
this. But I do deny that soul-study is a requirement
for the profession. If a man (or a woman)
has a soul it will not be a decorator who will discover
its fitting housing. Others may object,
"But bad taste is rampant. Surely it is better
to be guided by some one who knows than to surround
oneself with rocking chairs, plaster casts
of the Winged Victory, and photographs of various
madonnas." I say that it is <i>not</i> better. It is
better for each man to express himself, through his
taste, as well as through his tongue or his pen,
as he may. And it is only through such expression
that he will finally arrive (if he ever can) at
a condition of household furnishing which will say
something to his neighbour as well as to himself.
It is a pleasure when one leaves a dinner party to
be able to observe "That is <i>his</i> house," just as it
is a pleasure when one leaves a concert to remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that a composer has expressed himself and
not the result of seven years study in Berlin or
Paris.</p>

<p>But Americans have little aptitude for self-expression.
They prefer to huddle, like cattle, under
unspeakable whips when matters of art are
under discussion. They fear ridicule. As a consequence
many of the richest men in this country
never really live in their own homes, never are
comfortable for a moment, although the walls are
hung double with Fragonards and hawthorne
vases stand so deep upon the tables that no space
remains for the "Saturday Review" or "le
Temps." And they never, never, never, will know
the pleasure which comes while stumbling down a
side street in London, or in the mouldy corners of
the Venetian ghetto, or in the March&eacute; du Temple
in Paris, or, heaven knows, in New York, on lower
Fourth Avenue, or in Chinatown, or in a Russian
brass shop on Allen Street, or in a big department
store (as often there as anywhere) in finding
just the lamp for just the table in just the corner,
or in discovering a bit of brocade, perhaps the
ragged remnant of a waistcoat belonging to an
aristocrat of the Directorate, which will lighten
the depths of a certain room, or a chair which
goes miraculously with a desk already possessed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
or a Chinese mirror which one had almost decided
did not exist. Nor will they ever experience the
joy of sudden decision in front of a picture by
Matisse, which ends in the sale of a Delacroix.
Nor can they feel the thrill which is part of the
replacing of a make-shift rug by <i>the</i> rug of rugs
(let us hope it was Solomon's!).</p>

<p>I know a lady in Paris whose salon presents a
different aspect each summer. Do her Picassos
go, a new Spanish painter has replaced them.
Have you missed the Gibbons carving? Spanish
church carving has taken its place. "And where
are your Venetian embroideries?" "I sold them
to the Marquise de V.... The money served to
buy these Persian miniatures." This lady has
travelled far. She is not experimenting in doubtful
taste or bad art; she is not even experimenting
in her own taste: she is simply enjoying different
epochs, different artists, different forms of art,
each in its turn, for so long as it says anything
to her. Her house is not a museum. Space and
comfort demand exclusion but she excludes nothing
forever that she desires.... She exchanges.</p>

<p>Taste at best is relative. It is an axiom that
anybody else's taste can never say anything to
you although you may feel perfectly certain that
it is better than your own. If more of the money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of the rich were spent in encouraging children to
develop their own ideas in furnishing their own
rooms it would serve a better purpose than it does
now when it is dropped into the ample pockets of
the professional decorators. Oscar Wilde wrote,
"A colour sense is more important in the development
of the individual than a sense of right
and wrong." Any young boy or girl can learn
something about such matters; most of them, if
not shamed out of it, take a natural interest in
their surroundings. You will see how true this
is if you attempt to rearrange a child's room.
Those who have bad taste, relatively, should literally
be allowed to make their own beds. On the
whole it is preferable to be comfortable in red and
green velvet upholstery than to be beautiful and
unhappy in a household decorator's gilded cage.</p>

<h2><a name="Music_and_Supermusic" id="Music_and_Supermusic"></a>Music and Supermusic</h2>


<p>What is the distinction in the mind of
Everycritic between good music and
bad music, in the mind of Everyman
between popular music and "classical" music?
What is the essential difference between an air by
Mozart and an air by Jerome Kern? Why is
Chopin's <i>G minor nocturne</i> better music than
Th&eacute;cla Badarzewska's <i>La Pri&egrave;re d'une Vierge</i>?
Why is a music drama by Richard Wagner preferable
to a music drama by Horatio W. Parker?
What makes a melody distinguished? What
makes a melody commonplace or cheap? Why
do some melodies ring in our ears generation after
generation while others enjoy but a brief popularity?
Why do certain composers, such as Raff and
Mendelssohn, hailed as geniuses while they were
yet alive, soon sink into semi-obscurity, while
others, such as Robert Franz and Moussorgsky,
almost unrecognized by their contemporaries,
grow in popularity? Are there no answers to
these conundrums and the thousand others that
might be asked by a person with a slight attack
of curiosity?... No one <i>does</i> ask and assuredly
no one answers. These riddles, it would seem, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
included among the forbidden mysteries of the
sphynx. The critics assert with authority and
some show of erudition that the Spohrs, the
Mendelssohns, the Humperdincks, and the Montemezzis
are great composers. They usually admire
the grandchildren of Old Lady Tradition but they
neglect to justify this partiality. Nor can we
trust the public with its favourite Piccinnis and
Puccinis.... What then is the test of supermusic?</p>

<p>For we know, as well as we can know anything,
that there is music and supermusic. Rubinstein
wrote music; Beethoven wrote supermusic (Mr.
Finck may contradict this statement). Bellini
wrote operas; Mozart wrote superoperas. Jensen
wrote songs; Schubert wrote supersongs. The
superiority of <i>Voi che sapete</i> as a vocal melody
over <i>Ah! non giunge</i> is not generally contested;
neither can we hesitate very long over the question
whether or not <i>Der Leiermann</i> is a better song
than <i>Lehn' deine Wang'</i>. Probably even Mr. Finck
will admit that the <i>Sonata Appassionata</i> is finer
music than the most familiar portrait (I think it
is No. 22) in the <i>Kamennoi-Ostrow</i> set. But, if
we agree to put Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Schubert,
and a few others on marmorean pedestals
in a special Hall of Fame (and this is a compromise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
on my part, at any rate, as I consider much
of the music written by even these men to be below
any moderately high standard), what about the
rest? Mr. Finck prefers Johann Strauss to
Brahms, nay more to Richard himself! He has
written a whole book for no other reason, it would
seem, than to prove that the author of <i>Tod und
Verkl&auml;rung</i> is a very much over-rated individual.
At times sitting despondently in Carnegie Hall, I
am secretly inclined to agree with him. Personally
I can say that I prefer Irving Berlin's music to
that of Edward MacDowell and I would like to
have some one prove to me that this position is
untenable.</p>

<p>What is the test of supermusic? I have read
that fashionable music, music composed in a style
welcomed and appreciated by its contemporary
hearers is seldom supermusic. Yet Handel wrote
fashionable music, and so much other of the
music of that epoch is Handelian that it is
often difficult to be sure where George Frederick
left off and somebody else began. Bellini wrote
fashionable music and <i>Norma</i> and <i>La Sonnambula</i>
sound a trifle faded although they are still occasionally
performed, but Rossini, whose only desire
was to please his public, (Liszt once observed
"Rossini and Co. always close with 'I remain your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
very humble servant'"), wrote melodies in <i>Il
Barbiere di Siviglia</i> which sound as fresh to us today as
they did when they were first composed. And
when this prodigiously gifted musician-cook turned
his back to the public to write <i>Guillaume Tell</i> he
penned a work which critics have consistently told
us is a masterpiece, but which is as seldom performed
today as any opera of the early Nineteenth
Century which occasionally gains a hearing at all.
Therefor we must be wary of the old men who tell
us that we shall soon tire of the music of Puccini
because it is fashionable.</p>

<p>Popularity is scarcely a test. I have mentioned
Mendelssohn. Never was there a more popular
composer, and yet aside from the violin concerto
what work of his has maintained its place in the
concert repertory? Yet Chopin, whose name is
seldom absent from the program of a pianist, was
a god in his own time and the most brilliant woman
of his epoch fell in love with him, as Philip Moeller
has recently reminded us in his very amusing play.
On the other hand there is the case of Robert
Franz whose songs never achieved real popularity
during his lifetime, but which are frequently,
almost invariably indeed, to be found on song recital
programs today and which are more and
more appreciated. The critics are praising him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the public likes him: they buy his songs. And
there is also the case of Max Reger who was not
popular, is not popular, and never will be popular.</p>

<p>Can we judge music by academic standards?
Certainly not. Even the hoary old academicians
themselves can answer this question correctly if
you put it in relation to any composer born before
1820. The greatest composers have seldom
respected the rules. Beethoven in his last sonatas
and string quartets slapped all the pedants in the
ears; yet I believe you will find astonishingly few
rules broken by Mozart, one of the gods in the
mythology of art music, and Berlioz, who broke
all the rules, is more interesting to us today as a
writer of prose than as a writer of music.</p>

<p>Is simple music supermusic? Certainly not invariably.
<i>Vedrai Carino</i> is a simple tune, almost
as simple as a folk-song and we set great store
by it; yet Michael William Balfe wrote twenty-seven
operas filled with similarly simple tunes and
in a selective draft of composers his number would
probably be 9,768. The <i>Ave Maria</i> of Schubert
is a simple tune; so is the <i>Meditation</i> from <i>Thais</i>.
Why do we say that one is better than the other.</p>

<p>Or is supermusic always grand, sad, noble, or
emotional? There must be another violent head
shaking here. The air from <i>Oberon, Ocean, thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
mighty monster</i>, is so grand that scarcely a singer
can be found today capable of interpreting it, although
many sopranos puff and steam through it,
for all the world like pinguid gentlemen climbing
the stairs to the towers of Notre Dame. The
<i>Fifth Symphony</i> of Beethoven is both grand and
noble; probably no one will be found who will
deny that it is supermusic, but Mahler's <i>Symphony
of the Thousand</i> is likewise grand and noble, and
futile and bombastic to boot. <i>Or sai chi l'onore</i>
is a grand air, but <i>Robert je t'aime</i> is equally
grand in intention, at least. <i>Der Tod und das
M&auml;dchen</i> is sad; so is <i>Les Larmes</i> in <i>Werther</i>....
But a very great deal of supermusic is neither
grand nor sad. Haydn's symphonies are usually
as light-hearted and as light-waisted as possible.
Mozart's <i>Figaro</i> scarcely seems to have a care.
Listen to Beethoven's <i>Fourth</i> and <i>Eighth Symphonies</i>,
<i>Il Barbiere</i> again, <i>Die Meistersinger</i>....
But do not be misled: Massenet's <i>Don Quichotte</i>
is light music; so is Mascagni's <i>Lodoletta</i>....</p>

<p>Is music to be prized and taken to our hearts
because it is contrapuntal and complex? We frequently
hear it urged that Bach (who was more or
less forgotten for a hundred years, by the way)
was the greatest of composers and his music is especially
intricate. He is the one composer, indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
who can <i>never</i> be played with one finger!
But poor unimportant forgotten Max Reger also
wrote in the most complicated forms; the great
Gluck in the simplest. Gluck, indeed, has even
been considered weak in counterpoint and fugue.
Meyerbeer, it is said, was also weak in counterpoint
and fugue. Is he therefor to be regarded
as the peer of Gluck? Is Mozart's <i>G minor Symphony</i>
more important (because it is more complicated)
than the same composer's, <i>Batti, Batti</i>?</p>

<p>We learn from some sources that music stands
or falls by its melody but what is good melody?
According to his contemporaries Wagner's music
dramas were lacking in melody. <i>Sweet Marie</i> is
certainly a melody; why is it not as good a melody
as <i>The Old Folks at Home</i>? Why is Musetta's
waltz more popular than Gretel's? It is no better
as melody. As a matter of fact there is, has
been, and for ever will be war over this question
of melody, because the point of view on the subject
is continually changing. As Cyril Scott puts it
in his book, "The Philosophy of Modernism": "at
one time it (melody) extended over a few bars
and then came to a close, being, as it were, a kind
of sentence, which, after running for the moment,
arrived at a full stop, or semicolon. Take this
and compare it with the modern tendency: for that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
modern tendency is to argue that a melody might
go on indefinitely almost; there is no reason why
it should come to a full stop, for it is not a sentence,
but more a line, which, like the rambling incurvations
of a frieze, requires no rule to stop
it, but alone the will and taste of its engenderer."</p>

<p>Or is harmonization the important factor?
Folk-songs are not harmonized at all, and yet
certain musicians, Cecil Sharp for example, devote
their lives to collecting them, while others,
like Percy Grainger, base their compositions on
them. On the other hand such music as Debussy's
<i>Iberia</i> depends for its very existence on its beautiful
harmonies. The harmonies of Gluck are extremely
simple, those of Richard Strauss extremely
complex.</p>

<p>H. T. Finck says somewhere that one of the
greatest charms of music is modulation but the
old church composers who wrote in the "modes"
never modulated at all. Erik Satie seldom avails
himself of this modern device. It is a question
whether Leo Ornstein modulates. If we may take
him at his word Arnold Schoenberg has a system
of modulation. At least it is his very own.</p>

<p>Are long compositions better than short ones?
This may seem a silly question but I have read
criticisms based on a theory that they were.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Listen, for example, to de Quincy: "A song, an
air, a tune,&mdash;that is, a short succession of notes
revolving rapidly upon itself,&mdash;how could that by
possibility offer a field of compass sufficient for
the development of great musical effects? The
preparation pregnant with the future, the remote
correspondence, the questions, as it were, which
to a deep musical sense are asked in one passage,
and answered in another; the iteration and ingemination
of a given effect, moving through subtile
variations that sometimes disguise the theme,
sometimes fitfully reveal it, sometimes throw it out
tumultuously to the daylight,&mdash;these and ten
thousand forms of self-conflicting musical passion&mdash;what
room could they find, what opening, for
utterance, in so limited a field as an air or song?"
After this broadside permit me to quote a verse
of G&eacute;rard de Nerval:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Il est un air pour qui je donnerais</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tout Rossini, tout Mozart, et tout Weber,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Un air tr&egrave;s-vieux, languissant et fun&egrave;bre,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Qui pour moi seul a des charmes secrets."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And now let us dispassionately, if possible, regard
the evidence. Richard Strauss's <i>Alpine Symphony</i>,
admittedly one of his weakest works and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
considered very tiresome even by ardent Straussians,
plays for nearly an hour while any one can
sing <i>Der Erlk&ouml;nig</i> in three minutes. Are short
compositions better than long ones? Answer:
<i>Love me and the World is Mine</i> is a short song
(although it seldom sounds so) while Schubert's
<i>C major Symphony</i> is called the "symphony of
heavenly length."</p>

<p>Is what is new better than what is old? Is
what is old better than what is new? Schoenberg
is new; is he therefor to be considered better than
Beethoven? Stravinsky is new; is he therefor to
be considered worse than Liszt?</p>

<p>Is an opera better than a song? Compare
<i>Pagliacci</i> and Strauss's <i>St&auml;ndchen</i>. Is a string
quartet better than a piece for the piano? But
I grow weary.... Under the circumstances it
would seem that if you have any strong opinions
about music you are perfectly entitled to them,
for the critics do not agree and you will find many
of them basing their criticism on some of the
various hypotheses I have advanced. H. T. Finck
tells us that the sonata form is illogical, forgetting
perhaps that once it served its purpose; Jean
Marnold dubbed <i>Armide</i> an <i>&#339;uvre b&acirc;tarde</i>; John
F. Runciman called <i>Parsifal</i> "decrepit stuff,"
while Ernest Newman assures us that it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
"marvellous"; Pierre Lalo and Philip Hale disagree
on the subject of Debussy's <i>La Mer</i> while
W. J. Henderson and James Huneker wrangle over
Richard Strauss's <i>Don Quixote</i>.</p>

<p>The clue to the whole matter lies in a short
phrase: Imitative work is always bad. Music
that tries to be something that something else has
been may be thrown aside as worthless. It will
not endure although it may sometimes please the
zanies and jackoclocks of a generation. The
critic, therefor, who comes nearest to the heart of
the matter, is he who, either through instinct
or familiarity with the various phenomena of
music, is able to judge of a work's originality.
There must be individuality in new music to make
it worthy of our attention, and that, after all
is all that matters. For the tiniest folk-song
often persists in the hearts and minds of the people,
often stirs the pulse of a musician, pursuing
its tuneful way through two centuries, while a
mighty thundering symphony of the same period
may lie dead and rotting, food for the Niptus
Hololencus and the Blatta Germanica. We still
sing <i>The Old Folks At Home</i> and <i>Le Cycle du Vin</i>
but we have laid aside <i>Di Tanti Palpiti</i>. Any
piece of music possessing the certain magic power
of individuality is of value, it matters not whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
it be symphony or song, opera or dance. What
most critics have forgotten is that in Music matter,
form, and idea are one. In painting, in
poetry the idea, the words, the form, may be separated;
each may play its part, but in music there
is no idea without form, no form without idea.
That is what makes musical criticism difficult.</p>

<h2><a name="Edgar_Saltus" id="Edgar_Saltus"></a>Edgar Saltus</h2>


<p>To write about Edgar Saltus should be <i>vieux
jeu</i>. The man is an American; he was
born in 1858; he accomplished some of his
best work in the Eighties and the Nineties, in the
days when mutton-legged sleeves, whatnots,
Rogers groups, cat-tails, peacock feathers, Japanese
fans, musk-mellon seed collars, and big-wheeled
bicycles were in vogue. He has written
history, fiction, poetry, literary criticism, and
philosophy, and to all these forms he has brought
sympathy, erudition, a fresh point of view, and
a radiant style. He has imagination and he understands
the gentle art of arranging facts in
kaleidoscopic patterns so that they may attract
and not repel the reader. America, indeed, has
not produced a round dozen authors who equal
him as a brilliant stylist with a great deal to say.
And yet this man, who wrote some of his best books
in the Eighties and who is still alive, has been allowed
to drift into comparative oblivion. Even
his early reviewers shoved him impatiently aside
or ignored him altogether; a writer in "Belford's
Magazine" for July, 1888, says: "Edgar Saltus
should have his name changed to Edgar Assaulted."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Soon he became a literary leper. The
doctors and professors would have none of him.
To most of them, nowadays, I suppose, he is only
a name. Many of them have never read any of
his books. I do not even remember to have seen
him mentioned in the works of James Huneker
and you will not find his name in Barrett Wendell's
"A History of American Literature"
(1901), "A Reader's History of American Literature"
by Thomas Wentworth Higginson and
Henry Walcott Boynton (1903), Katherine Lee
Bates's "American Literature" (1898), "A
Manual of American Literature," edited by Theodore
Stanton (1909), William B. Cairns's "A
History of American Literature" (1912), William
Edward Simonds's "A Student's History of
American Literature" (1909), Fred Lewis Pattee's
"A History of American Literature Since
1870" (1915), John Macy's "The Spirit of
American Literature" (1913), or William Lyon
Phelps's "The Advance of the English Novel"
(1916). The third volume of "The Cambridge
History of American Literature," bringing the
subject up to 1900, has not yet appeared but I
should be amazed to discover that the editors had
decided to include Saltus therein. Curiously
enough he is mentioned in Oscar Fay Adams's "A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Dictionary of American Authors" (1901 edition)
and, of all places, I have found a reference to
him in one of Agnes Repplier's books.</p>

<p>You will find few essays about the man or his
work in current or anterior periodicals. There
is, to be sure, the article by Ramsay Colles,
entitled "A Publicist: Edgar Saltus," published
in the "Westminster Magazine" for October,
1904, but this essay could have won our author no
adherents. If any one had the courage to wade
through its muddy paragraphs he doubtless
emerged vowing never to read Saltus. Besides
only the novels are touched on. In 1903 G. F.
Monkshood and George Gamble arranged a compilation
from Saltus's work which they entitled
"Wit and Wisdom from Edgar Saltus" (Greening
and Co., London). The work is done without
sense or sensitiveness and the prefatory essay
is without salt or flavour of any sort. An
anonymous writer in "Current Literature" for
July, 1907, asks plaintively why this author has
been permitted to remain in obscurity and quotes
from some of the reviews. In "The Philistine"
for October, 1907, Elbert Hubbard takes a hand
in the game. He says, "Edgar Saltus is the best
writer in America&mdash;with a few insignificant exceptions,"
but he deplores the fact that Saltus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
knows nothing about the cows and chickens; only
cities and gods seem to interest him. Still there
is some atmosphere in this study, which is devoted
to one book, "The Lords of the Ghostland." In
the New York Public Library four of Saltus's
books and one of his translations (about one-sixth
of his published work) are listed. You may
also find there in a series of volumes entitled "Nations
of the World" his supplementary chapters
bringing the books up to date. That is all.</p>

<p>All these years, of course, Saltus has had his
admiring circle,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> people of intelligence, of whom,
unfortunately, I cannot say that I was one.
These, who have been content to read and admire
without spreading the news, may well be inclined
to regard my performance as repetitive and impertinent.
Of these I must crave indulgence and
of Saltus himself too. For he, knowing how well
he has done his work, must sit like Buddha, ironic
and indulgent, smiling on the poor benighted who
have yet to approach his altars. Once, at least,
he spoke: "A book that pleases no one may be
poor. The book that pleases every one is detestable."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>I seem to remember to have heard his name all
my life, but until recently I have not read one
line concerning or by him. I find that my friends,
many of whom are extensive readers, are in the
same sad state of ignorance. There is an exception
and that exception is responsible for my conversion.
For six years, no less, Edna Kenton has
been urging me to read Edgar Saltus. She has
been gently insinuating but firm. None of us can
struggle forever against fate or a determined
woman. In the end I capitulated, purchased a
book by Edgar Saltus at random, and read it
... at one sitting. I sought for more. As most
of his books are out of print and as the list in
the Public Library conspicuously omits all but
one of his best <i>opera</i> the matter presented difficulties.
However, a little diligent search in the
old book shops accomplished wonders. In less
than two weeks I had dug up twenty-two titles
and in less than two weeks I had read twenty-four;
since then I have consumed the other four.
There are few writers in American or any other
literature who can survive such a test; there are
few writers who have given me such keen pleasure.</p>

<p>The events of his life, mostly remain shrouded
in mystery. His comings and goings are not reported
in the newspapers; he does not make public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
speeches; and his name is seldom, if ever, mentioned
"among those present." That he has been
married and has one daughter "Who's Who"
proclaims, together with the few biographical details
mentioned below. That is all. May we not
herein find some small explanation for his apparent
neglect? Many thousands of lesser men
have lifted themselves to "literary" prominence
by blowing their own tubas and striking their own
crotals. Even in the case of a man of such manifest
genius as George Bernard Shaw we may
be permitted to doubt if he would be so well known,
had he not taken the trouble to erect monuments
to himself on every possible occasion in every
possible location. Fame is a quaint old-fashioned
body, who loves to be pursued. She seldom,
if ever, runs after anybody except in her well-known
r&ocirc;le of necrophile.</p>

<p>Edgar Evertson Saltus was born in New York
City June 8, 1858. He is a lineal descendant of
Admiral Kornelis Evertson, the commander of the
Dutch fleet, who captured New York from the English,
August 9, 1673. Francis Saltus, the poet,
was his brother. He enjoyed a cosmopolitan education
which may be regarded as an important
factor in the development of his tastes and ideas.
From St. Paul's School in Concord he migrated to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the Sorbonne in Paris, and thence to Heidelberg
and Munich, where he bathed in the newer Germanic
philosophies. Finally he took a course of
law at Columbia University. The influence of
this somewhat heterogeneous seminary life is manifest
in all his future writing. Beginning, no
doubt, as a disciple of Emerson in New England,
he fell under the spell of Balzac in Paris, of
Schopenhauer and von Hartmann in Germany.
Pages might be brought forward as evidence that
he had a thorough classical education. His
knowledge of languages made it easy for him to
drink deeply at many fountain heads. If Oscar
Wilde found his chief inspiration in Huysmans's
"A Rebours," it is certain that Saltus also quaffed
intoxicating draughts at this source. Indeed in
one of his books he refers to Huysmans as his
friend. It is further apparent that he is acquainted
with the works of Barbey d'Aurevilly,
Josephin P&eacute;ladan,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Baudelaire, Mallarm&eacute;, Verlaine,
Arthur Rimbaud, Catulle Mend&egrave;s, and Jules
Laforgue, especially the Laforgue of the "Moralit&eacute;s
Legendaires." His kinship with these writers
is near, but through this mixed blood run strains
inherited from the early pagans, the mediaeval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
monks, the Germanic philosophers, and London of
the Eighteen Nineties (although there is not one
word about Saltus in Holbrook Jackson's book of
the period), and perhaps, after all, his nearest literary
relative was an American, Edgar Allan Poe,
who bequeathed to him a garret full of strange
odds and ends. But Saltus surpasses Poe in almost
every respect save as a poet.</p>

<p>Joseph Hergesheimer has expressed a theory to
the effect that great art is always provincial, never
cosmopolitan; that only provincial art is universal
in its appeal. Like every other theory this one is
to a large extent true, but Hergesheimer in his arbitrary
summing up, has forgotten the fantastic.
The fantastic in literature, in art of any kind, can
never be provincial. The work of Poe is not provincial;
nor is that of Gustave Moreau, an artist
with whom Edgar Saltus can very readily be compared.
If you have visited the Mus&eacute;e Moreau in
Paris where, in the studio of the dead painter, is
gathered together the most complete collection of
his works, which lend themselves to endless inspection,
you can, in a sense, reconstruct for yourself
an idea of the works of Edgar Saltus. One finds
therein the same unicorns, the same fabulous monsters,
the same virgins on the rocks, the same exotic
and undreamed of flora and fauna, the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
mystic paganism, the same exquisitely jewelled
workmanship. One can find further analogies in
the Aubrey Beardsley of "Under the Hill," in the
elaborate stylized irony of Max Beerbohm.
Surely not provincials these, but just as surely
artists.</p>

<p>Moreover Saltus's style may be said to possess
American characteristics. It is dashing and
rapid, and as clear as the water in Southern seas.
The man has a penchant for short and nervous
sentences, but they are never jerky. They explode
like so many firecrackers and remind one
of the great national holiday!... Nevertheless
Edgar Saltus should have been born in France.</p>

<p>His essays, whether they deal with literary
criticism, history, religion (which is almost an
obsession with this writer), devil-worship, or cooking,
are pervaded by that rare quality, charm.
Somewhere he quotes a French aphorism:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Etre riche n'est pas l'affaire,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Toute l'affaire est de charmer</i>,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which might be applied to his own work. There
is a deep and beneficent guile in the simplicity of
his style, as limpid as a brook, and yet, as over a
brook, in its overtones hover a myriad of sparkling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
dragon-flies and butterflies; in its depths lie
a plethora of trout. He deals with the most obstruse
and abstract subjects with such ease and
grace, without for one moment laying aside the
badge of authority, that they assume a mysterious
fascination to catch the eye of the passerby.
In his fictions he has sometimes cultivated a more
hectic style, but that in itself constitutes one of
the bases of its richness. Scarcely a word but
evokes an image, a strange, bizarre image, often a
complication of images. He is never afraid of
the colloquial, never afraid of slang even, and he
often weaves lovely patterns with obsolete or technical
words. These lines, in which Saltus paid
tribute to Gautier, he might, with equal justice,
have applied to himself: "No one could torment
a fancy more delicately than he; he had the gift of
adjective; he scented a new one afar like a truffle;
and from the Morgue of the dictionary he dragged
forgotten beauties. He dowered the language of
his day with every tint of dawn and every convulsion
of sunset; he invented metaphors that were
worth a king's ransom, and figures of speech that
deserve the Prix Montyon. Then reviewing his
work, he formulated an axiom which will go down
with a nimbus through time: Whomsoever a
thought however complex, a vision however apocalyptic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
surprises without words to convey it, is not
a writer. The inexpressible does not exist." It
is impossible to taste at this man's table. One
must eat the whole dinner to appreciate its opulent
inevitability. Still I may offer a few olives, a
branch or two of succulent celery to those who
have not as yet been invited to sit down. One of
his ladies walks the Avenue in a gown the "color of
fried smelts." Such figurative phrases as "Her
eyes were of that green-grey which is caught in
an icicle held over grass," "The sand is as fine as
face powder, <i>nuance</i> Rachel, packed hard,"
"Death, it may be, is not merely a law but a place,
perhaps a garage which the traveller reaches on a
demolished motor, but whence none can proceed
until all old scores are paid," "The ocean resembled
nothing so much as an immense blue syrup,"
"She was a pale freckled girl, with hair the shade
of Bavarian beer," "The sun rose from the ocean
like an indolent girl from her bath," "Night, that
queen who reigns only when she falls, shook out the
shroud she wears for gown," are to be found on
every page. Certain phrases sound good to him
and are re-used: "Disappearances are deceptive,"
"ruedelapaixian" (to describe a dress),
"toilet of the ring" (lifted from the bull-fight in
"Mr. Incoul's Misadventure" to do service in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
account of the arena games under Nero in "Imperial
Purple"), but repetition of this kind is infrequent
in his works and seemingly unnecessary.
Ideas and phrases, endless chains of them, spurt
from the point of his ardent pen. Standing on his
magic carpet he shakes new sins out of his sleeve as
a conjurer shakes out white rabbits and juggles
words with an exquisite dexterity. He is, indeed,
the <i>jongleur de notre &acirc;me</i>!</p>

<p>From the beginning, his style has attracted the
attention of the few and no one, I am sure, has
ever written a three line review of a book by
Saltus without referring to it. Mme. Am&eacute;lie
Rives has quoted Oscar Wilde as saying to her one
night at dinner, "In Edgar Saltus's work passion
struggles with grammar on every page!" Percival
Pollard has dubbed him a "prose paranoiac,"
and Elbert Hubbard says, "He writes so well that
he grows enamoured of his own style and is subdued
like the dyer's hand; he becomes intoxicated
on the lure of lines and the roll of phrases. He
is woozy on words&mdash;locoed by syntax and prosody.
The libation he pours is flavoured with euphues.
It is all like a cherry in a morning Martini."
A phrase which Remy de Gourmont uses
to describe Villiers de l'Isle Adam might be applied
with equal success to the author of "The Lords of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the Ghostland": "<i>L'id&eacute;alisme de Villiers &eacute;tait un
v&eacute;ritable id&eacute;alisme verbal, c'est-&agrave;-dire qu'il croyait
vraiment &agrave; la puissance &eacute;vocatrice des mots, &agrave;
leur vertu magique.</i>" And we may listen to Saltus's
own testimony in the matter: "It may be
noted that in literature only three things count,
style, style polished, style repolished; these
imagination and the art of transition aid, but do
not enhance. As for style, it may be defined as the
sorcery of syllables, the fall of sentences, the use
of the exact term, the pursuit of a repetition
even unto the thirtieth and fortieth line. Grammar
is an adjunct but not an obligation. No
grammarian ever wrote a thing that was fit to
read."</p>

<p>At his worst&mdash;and his worst can be monstrous!&mdash;garbed
fantastically in purple patches and
gaudy rags, he wallows in muddy puddles of Burgundy
and gold dust; even then he is unflagging
and holds the attention in a vise. His women
have eyes which are purple pools, their hair is
bitten by combs, their lips are scarlet threads.
Even the names of his characters, Roanoke Raritan,

Jones, Stella Sixmuth, Violet Silverstairs, Sallie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Malakoff, Shane Wyvell, Dugald Maule, Eden
Menemon (it will be observed that he has a persistent,
balefully procacious, perhaps, indeed,
Freudian predilection for the letters U, V, and
X),<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are fantastic and fabulous ... sometimes
almost frivolous. And here we may find our
paradox. His sense of humour is abnormal,
sometimes expressed directly by way of epigram
or sly wording but may it not also occasionally
express itself indirectly in these purple
towers of painted velvet words, extravagant
fables, and unbelievable characters he is so fond of
erecting? Some of his work almost approaches
the burlesque in form. He carries his manner to
a point where he seems to laugh at it himself, and
then, with a touch of poignant realism or a poetic
phrase, he confounds the reader's judgment. The
virtuosity of the performance is breath-taking!</p>

<p>He is always the snob (somewhere he defends the
snob in an essay): rich food ("half-mourning"
[artichoke hearts and truffles], "filet of reindeer,"
a cygnet in its plumage bearing an orchid in its
beak, "heron's eggs whipped with wine into an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
amber foam," "mashed grasshoppers baked in
saffron"), rich clothes, rich people interest him.
There is no poverty in his books. His creatures
do not toil. They cut coupons off bonds. Sometimes
they write or paint, but for the most part
they are free to devote themselves exclusively to
the pursuit of emotional experience, eating, reading,
and travelling the while. And when they
have finished dining they wipe their hands, wetted
in a golden bowl, in the curly hair of a tiny serving
boy. A character in "Madam Sapphira"
explains this tendency: "A writer, if he happens
to be worth his syndicate, never chooses a subject.
The subject chooses him. He writes what
he must, not what he might. That's the thing the
public can't understand."</p>

<p>There is always a preoccupation with ancient
life, sometimes freely expressed as in "Imperial
Purple," but more often suggested by plot, phrase,
or scene. He kills more people than Caligula
killed during the whole course of his bloody reign.
Murders, suicides, and other forms of sudden death
flash their sensations across his pages. Webster
and the other Elizabethans never steeped themselves
so completely in gore. In almost every book there
is an orgy of death and he has been ingenious in
varying its forms. The poisons of rafflesia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
muscarine, and orsere are introduced in his fictions;
somewhere he devotes an essay to toxicology.
Daggers with blades like needles, pistols, drownings,
asphyxiations, play their r&ocirc;les ... and in
one book there is a crucifixion!</p>

<p>Again I find that Mr. Saltus has said his word
on the subject: "In fiction as in history it is
the shudder that tells. Hugo could find no higher
compliment for Baudelaire than to announce that
the latter had discovered a new one. For new
shudders are as rare as new vices; antiquity has
made them all seem trite. The apt commingling
of the horrible and the trivial, pathos and ferocity,
is yet the one secret of enduring work&mdash;a secret,
parenthetically, which Hugo knew as no one else."</p>

<p>His fables depend in most instances upon sexual
abberrations, curious coincidences, fantastic happenings.
Rapes and incests decorate his pages.
He does not ask us to believe his monstrous
stories; he compels us to. He carries us by
means of the careless expenditure of many passages
of somewhat ribald beauty, along with him,
captive to his pervasive charm. We are constantly
reminded, in endless, almost wearisome,
imagery, of gold and purple, foreign languages,
esoteric philosophies, foods the names of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
strike the ear as graciously as they themselves
might strike the tongue. From Huysmans he has
learned the formula for ravishing all our senses.
Words are often used for their own sakes to call
up images, colour flits across every page, across,
indeed, every line. We taste, we smell, we see.
There is the pomp and circumstance of the Roman
Catholic ritual in these pages, the Roman Catholic
ritual well supplied with mythical monsters, singing
flowers, and blooming women. Strange scarlet
and mulberry threads form the woof of these
tapestries, threads pulled with great labour from
all the art of the past. There is, in much of his
work, an undercurrent of subtle sensuous erotic
poison; in one of her stories Edna Kenton tells us
that <i>chartreuse jaune</i> and bananas form such a
poison. There is a suggestion of <i>chartreuse jaune</i>
and bananas in much of the work of Edgar Saltus.</p>

<p>He is constantly obsessed by the mysteries of
love and death, the veils of Isis, the secrets of
Moses. While others were delving in the American
soil his soul sped afar; he is not even a cosmopolitan;
he is a Greek, a Brahmin, a worshipper
of Ishtar. There is a prodigious and prodigal
display of genius in his work, savannahs of epigrams,
forests of ideas, phrases enough to fill the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
ocean.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> There is enough material in the romances
of Edgar Saltus to furnish all the cinema companies
in America with scenarios for a twelve-month.</p>

<p>Early in the Eighties a writer in "The Argus"
referred to him as "the prose laureate of pessimism."
His philosophy may be summed up in a
few phrases: Nothing matters, Whatever will be
is, Everything is possible, and Since we live today
let us make the best of it and live in Paris. And
through all the <i>opera</i> of Saltus, through the rapes
and murders, the religious, philosophical, and social
discussions, rings Cherubino's still unanswered
question, <i>Che cosa e amor?</i> like a persistent refrain.</p>

<p>After having said so much it seems unnecessary
to add that I strongly advise the reader to go out
and buy all the books of Edgar Saltus he can
find (and to find many will require patience and
dexterity, as most of them are out of print). To
further aid him in the matter I have prepared a
short catalogue and with his permission I will
guide him gently through this new land. I have
also added a list of publishers, together with the
dates of publication, although I cannot, in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
instances, vouch for their having been the original
imprints. It may be noted that almost all his
books have been reprinted in England.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Balzac,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> signed Edgar Evertson Saltus (for
a time he used his full name) is such good literary
criticism and such good personal biography that
one wishes the author had tried the form again.
He did not save in his prefaces to his translations,
his essay on Victor Hugo, and his short study of
Oscar Wilde. In its miniature way, for the book
is slight, "Balzac" is as good of its kind as James
Huneker's "Chopin," Auguste Ehrhard's "Fanny
Elssler," and Frank Harris's "Oscar Wilde." In
style it is superior to any of these. It is a very
pretty performance for a d&eacute;but and if it is out
of print, as I think it is, some enterprising publisher
should serve it to the public in a new edition.
The two most interesting chapters, largely anecdotal
but continuously illuminating, are entitled
"The Vagaries of Genius," wherein one may find
an infinitude of details concerning the manner in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
which Balzac worked, and "The Chase for Gold,"
but tucked in somewhere else is a charming digression
about realism in fiction and the bibliography
should still be of use to students. Saltus tells
us that Balzac took all his characters' names from
life, frequently from signs which he observed on the
street. In this respect Saltus certainly has not
followed him; in another he has been more imitative:
I refer to the Balzacian trick of carrying
people from one book to another.</p>

<p>"The Philosophy of Disenchantment"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is an
ingratiating account of the pessimism of Schopenhauer,
a philosophy with which it would seem, Saltus
is fully in accord. Two-thirds of the book is
allotted to Schopenhauer, but the remainder is
devoted to an exposition of the teachings of von
Hartmann and a final essay, "Is Life an Affliction?"
which query the author seems to answer in
the affirmative. One of the best-known of the
Saltus books, "The Philosophy of Disenchantment"
is written in a clear, translucent style
without the iridescence which decorates his later
<i>opera</i>.</p>

<p>"After-Dinner Stories from Balzac, done into
English by Myndart Verelst (obviously E. S.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
with an introduction by Edgar Saltus"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> contains
four of the Frenchman's tales, "The Red Inn,"
"Madame Firmiani," "The 'Grande Bret&egrave;che',"
and "Madame de Beaus&eacute;ant." The introduction
is written in Saltus's most beguiling manner and
may be referred to as one of the most delightful
short essays on Balzac extant. The dedication is
to V. A. B.</p>

<p>"The Anatomy of Negation"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is Saltus's best
book in his earlier manner, which is as free from
flamboyancy as early Gothic, and one of his most
important contributions to our literature. The
work is a history of antitheism from Kapila to
Leconte de Lisle and, while the writer in a brief
prefatory notice disavows all responsibility for
the opinions of others, it can readily be felt that
the book is a labour of love and that his sympathy
lies with the iconoclasts through the centuries.
The chapter entitled, "The Convulsions of the
Church," a brief history of Christianity, is one of
the most brilliant passages to be found in any of
the works of this very brilliant writer. Indeed, if
you are searching for the soul of Saltus you could
not do better than turn to this chapter. Of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Jesus he says, "He was the most entrancing of
nihilists but no innovator." Here is another excerpt:
"Paganism was not dead; it had merely
fallen asleep. Isis gave way to Mary; apotheosis
was replaced by canonization; the divinities were
succeeded by saints; and, Africa aiding, the
Church surged from mythology with the Trinity
for tiara." Again: "Satan was Jew from horn
to hoof. The registry of his birth is contained in
the evolution of Hebraic thought." Never was
any book so full of erudition and ideas so easy to
read, a fascinating <i>opus</i>, written by a true sceptic.
Following the Baedeker system, adopted so
amusingly by Henry T. Finck in his "Songs and
Song Writers," this book should be triple-starred.</p>

<p>"Tales before Supper, from Th&eacute;ophile Gautier
and Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, told in English by Myndart
Verelst and delayed with a proem by Edgar Saltus."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Translation again. The stories are
"Avatar" and "The Venus of Ille." The essay
at the beginning is a very charming performance.
This book is dedicated to E. C. R.</p>

<p>"Mr. Incoul's Misadventure,"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Saltus's first
novel, is also the best of his numerous fictions. It,
too, should be triple-starred in any guide book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
through this <i>opus</i>-land. In it will be found, super-distilled,
the very essence of all the best qualities
of this writer. It is written with fine reserve;
the story holds; the characters are unusually well
observed, felt, and expressed. Irony shines
through the pages and the final cadence includes a
murder and a suicide. For the former, bromide
of potassium and gas are utilized in combination;
for the latter laudanum, taken hypodermically,
suffices. There are scenes in Biarritz and Northern
Spain which include a thrilling picture of a
bull-fight. There is an interesting glimpse of the
Paris Op&eacute;ra. There is a description of an epithumetic
library which embraces many forbidden
titles, (How that "baron of moral endeavour ... the
professional hound of heaven," Anthony Comstock,
would have gloated over these shelves!), a
vibrant page about Goya, and another about a
Thibetian cat. Many passages could be brought
forward as evidence that Mr. Saltus loves the fire-side
sphynx. The Mr. Incoul of the title gives one
a very excellent idea of how inhuman a just man
can be. There is not a single slip in the skilful
delineation of this monster. The beautiful heroine
vaguely shambles into a tapestried background.
She is <i>moyen age</i> in her appealing weakness. The
<i>jeune premier</i>, Lenox Leigh, is well drawn and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
lighted. Time after time the author strikes subtle
harmonies which must have delighted Henry
James. Why is this book not dedicated to
author of "The Turn of the Screw" rather than
to "E. A. S."? The pages are permeated with
suspense, horror, information, irony, and charm,
about evenly distributed, all of which qualities are
expressed in the astounding title (astounding after
you have read the book). There is a white marriage
in this tale, stipulated in the hymeneal bond.
In 1877 Tschaikovsky made a similar agreement
with the woman he married.</p>

<p>"The Truth About Tristrem Varick"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is written
with the same restraint which characterizes the
style of "Mr. Incoul's Misadventure," a restraint
seldom to be encountered in Saltus's later fictions.
One of the angles of the plot in which an irate
father attempts to suppress a marriage by suggesting
incest, bobs up twice again in his stories,
for the last time nearly thirty years later in
"The Monster." Irony is the keynote of the
work, a keynote sounded in the dedication, "To
my master, the philosopher of the unconscious,
Eduard von Hartmann, this attempt in ornamental
disenchantment is dutifully inscribed." The
heroine, as frequently happens with Saltus heroines,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
is veiled with the mysteries of Isis; we do
not see the workings of her mind and so we can
sympathize with Varick, who pursues her with
persistent misunderstanding and arduous devotion
through 240 pages. He attributes her aloofness
to his father's unfounded charge against his
mother and her father. When he learns that she
has borne a child he suspects rape and, with a
needle-like dagger that leaves no sign, he kills the
man he believes to have seduced her. Then he
goes to the lady to receive her thanks, only to learn
that she loved the man he has killed. Varick
gives himself into the hands of the police, confesses,
and is delivered to justice, the lady gloating.
A strikingly pessimistic tale, only less good
than "Mr. Incoul." There is superb writing in
these pages, many delightful passages. <i>La Cenerentola</i>
and <i>Lucrezia Borgia</i> are mentioned in passing.
Saltus has (or had) an exuberant fondness
for Donizetti and Rossini. Here is a telling bit
of art criticism (attributed to a character) descriptive
of the Paris Salon: "There was a
Manet or two, a Moreau and a dozen excellent
landscapes, but the rest represented the apotheosis
of mediocrity. The pictures which Gerome,
Cabanel, Bouguereau, and the acolytes of these
pastry-cooks exposed were stupid and sterile as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
church doors." This required courage in 1888.
One wonders where Kenyon Cox was at the time!
Give this book at least two stars.</p>

<p>"Eden"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> is the third of Saltus's fictions and
possibly the poorest of the three. Eden is the
name of the heroine whose further name is Menemon.
Stuyvesant Square is her original habitat
but she migrates to Fifth Avenue. The tide is
flowing South again nowadays. Her husband is
almost too good, but nevertheless appearances
seem against him until he explains that the lady
with whom he has been seen in a cab is his daughter
by a former marriage, and the young man who
seems to have been making love to Eden is his son.
Characteristic of Saltus is the use of the Spanish
word for nightingale. There are no deaths, no
suicides, no murders in these pages: a very
eunuch of a book! A motto from Tasso, "<i>Perdute
e tutto il tempo che in amor non si spende</i>" adorns
the title page and the work is dedicated to
"E&mdash;&mdash;H Amicissima."</p>

<p>With "The Pace that Kills"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Saltus doffs his
old coat and dons a new and gaudier garment.
Possibly he owed this change in style to the influence
of the London movement so interestingly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>described
in Holbrook Jackson's "The Eighteen-Nineties."
The book begins with abortion and
ends with a drop over a ferry-boat into the icy
East River. There is an averted strangulation of
a baby and for the second time in a Saltus <i>opus</i> a
dying millionaire leaves his fortune to the St.
Nicholas Hospital. Was Saltus ballyhooing for
this institution? The hero is a modern Don Juan.
Alphabet Jones appears occasionally, as he does in
many of the other novels. This Balzacian trick
obsessed the author for a time. The book is
dedicated to John S. Rutherford and bears as a
motto on its title page this quotation from Rabusson:
"<i>Pourquoi la mort? Dites, plut&ocirc;t, pourquoi
la vie?</i>"</p>

<p>In "A Transaction in Hearts"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the Reverend
Christopher Gonfallon falls in love with his wife's
sister, Claire. A New England countess, a subsidiary
figure, suggests d'Aurevilly. This story
originally appeared in "Lippincott's Magazine"
and the editor who accepted it was dismissed. A
year or so later a new editor published "The Picture
of Dorian Gray." Still later Saltus tells me
he met Oscar Wilde in London and the Irish poet
asked him for news of the new editor. "He's quite
well," answered Saltus. Wilde did not seem to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
pleased: "When your story appeared the editor
was removed; when mine appeared I supposed he
would be hanged. Now you tell me he is quite
well. It is most disheartening." Saltus then
asked Wilde why Dorian Gray was cut by his
friends. Wilde turned it over. "I fancy they
saw him eating fish with his knife."</p>

<p>"A Transient Guest and other Episodes"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> contains
three short tales besides the title story:
"The Grand Duke's Riches," an account of an
ingenious robbery at the Brevoort, "A Maid of
Athens," and "Fausta," a story of love, revenge,
and death in Cuba. If the final cadence of the
book is a dagger thrust the prelude is a subtle poison,
rafflesia, a Sumatran plant, intended for the
hero, Tancred Ennever, but consumed with fatal
results by his faithful fox terrier, Zut Alors.
The story is arresting and, as frequently happens
in Saltus romances, a man finds himself no match
for a woman. "A Transient Guest" is dedicated
to K. J. M.</p>

<p>The slender volume entitled "Love and Lore"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
contains a short series of slight essays, interrupted
by slighter sonnets, on subjects which, for the
most part, Saltus has treated at greater length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and with greater effect elsewhere. He makes a
whimsical plea for a modern revival of the Court
of Love and in "Morality in Fiction" he derides
that Puritanism in American letters whose dark
scourge H. L. Mencken still pursues with a cat-o'-nine-tails
and a hand grenade. He gives us a fanciful
set of rules for a novelist which, happily, he
has ignored in his own fictions. The most interesting,
personal, and charming chapter, although
palpably derived from "The Philosophy of Disenchantment,"
is that entitled "What Pessimism
Is Not"; here again we are in the heart of the
author's philosophy. Those who like to read
books about the Iberian Peninsula can scarcely
afford to miss "Fabulous Andalucia," in which an
able brief for the race of Othello is presented:
"Under the Moors, Cordova surpassed Baghdad.
They wrote more poetry than all the other nations
put together. It was they who invented rhyme;
they wrote everything in it, contracts, challenges,
treaties, treatises, diplomatic notes and messages
of love. From the earliest khalyf down to Boabdil,
the courts of Granada, of Cordova and of
Seville were peopled with poets, or, as they were
termed, with makers of Ghazels. It was they who
gave us the dulcimer, the hautbois and the guitar;
it was they who invented the serenade. We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
indebted to them for algebra and for the canons of
chivalry as well.... It was from them that came
the first threads of light which preceded the
Renaissance. Throughout mediaeval Europe they
were the only people that thought." The book is
dedicated to Edgar Fawcett, "perfect poet&mdash;perfect
friend" and is embellished with a portrait
of its author.</p>

<p>"The Story Without a Name"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> is a translation
of "Une Histoire Sans Nom" of Barbey
d'Aurevilly, and is preceded by one of Saltus's
charming and atmospheric literary essays, the best
on d'Aurevilly to be found in English. When this
book first appeared, Mr. Saltus informs me, a reviewer,
"who contrived to be both amusing and
complimentary," said that Barbey d'Aurevilly was
a fictitious person and that this vile story was
Saltus's own vile work!</p>

<p>"Mary Magdalen,"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> on the whole disappointing,
is nevertheless one of the important Saltus
<i>opera</i>. The opening chapters, like Oscar
Wilde's <i>Salome</i> (published two years later than
"Mary Magdalen") owe much to Flaubert's
"H&eacute;rodias." The dance on the hands is a detail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
from Flaubert, a detail which Tissot followed in
his painting of Salome.... From the later chapters
it is possible that Paul Heyse filched an idea.
The turning point of his drama, <i>Maria von Magdala</i>,
hinges on Judas's love for Mary and his
jealousy of Jesus. Saltus develops exactly this
situation. Heyse's play appeared in 1899, eight
years after Saltus's novel. However, Saltus has
protested to me that it is an idea that might have
occurred to any one. "I put it in," he added, "to
make the action more nervous." The book begins
well with a description of Herod's court and Rome
in Judea, but as a whole it is unsatisfactory.
Once the plot develops Saltus seems to lose interest.
He lazily quotes whole scenes from the
Bible (George Moore very cleverly avoided this
pitfall in "The Brook Kerith"). The early
chapters suggest "Imperial Purple," which appeared
a year later and upon which he may well
have been at work at this time. There is a foreshadowing,
too, of "The Lords of the Ghostland"
in a very amusing and slightly cynical passage
in which Mary as a child listens to Sephorah
the sorceress tell legends and myths of Assyria and
Egypt. Mary interrupts with "Why you mean
Moses! You mean Noah!" just as a child of today,
if confronted with the situations in the Greek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
dramas would attribute them to Bayard Veiller or
Eugene Walter. Saltus is too much of a scholar
to find much novelty in Christianity. But aside
from this passage cynicism is lacking from this
book, a quality which makes another story on the
same theme, "Le Procurateur de Jud&eacute;e," one of
the greatest short stories in any language.
Mary's sins are quickly passed over and we come
almost immediately to her conversion. Herod
Antipas, with his "fan-shaped beard" and vacillating
Pilate, quite comparable to a modern politician,
are the most human and best-realized characters
in a book which should have been greater
than it is. "Mary Magdalen" is dedicated to
Henry James.</p>

<p>"The facts in the Curious Case of H. Hyrtl,
esq."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is a slight yarn in the mellow Stevenson
manner, with a kindly old gentleman as the messenger
of the supernatural who provides the
wherewithal for a marriage between an impoverished
artist, who is painting Heliogabolus's feast
of roses, and his sweet young thing. Quite a
departure this from the usual Saltus manner;
nevertheless there are two deaths, one by shock,
the other in a railway accident. The plot depends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
on as many impossible entrances and exits
as a Palais Royal farce and the reader is asked
to believe in many coincidences. The book is dedicated
to Lorillard Ronalds who, the author explains
in a few French phrases, asked him to write
something "<i>de tr&egrave;s pure et de tr&egrave;s chaste, pour une
jeunesse, sans doute</i>." He adds that the story is
a rewriting of a tale which had appeared twenty
years earlier.</p>

<p>"Imperial Purple"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> marks the high-tide of
Saltus's peculiar genius. The emperors of imperial
decadent Rome are led by the chains of art
behind the chariot wheels of the poet: Julius
C&aelig;sar, whom Cato called "that woman," Augustus,
Tiberius, Caligula, the wicked Agrippina, for
whom Agnes Repplier named her cat, Claudius,
Nero, Hadrian, Vespasian, down to the incredible
Heliogabolus. Saltus, who has given us many
vivid details concerning the lives of his predecessors,
seemingly falters at this dread name, but only
seemingly. More can be found about this extraordinary
and perverse emperor in Lombard's
"L'Agonie" and in Franz Blei's "The Powder
Puff," but, although Saltus is brief, he evokes an
atmosphere and a picture in a few short paragraphs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
The sheer lyric quality of this book has
remained unsurpassed by this author. Indeed it is
rare in all literature. Page after page that Walter
Pater, Oscar Wilde, or J. K. Huysmans might
have been glad to sign might be set before you.
The man writes with invention, with sap, with
urge. Our eyes are not clogged with foot-notes
and references. It is plain that our author has
delved in the "Scriptores Histori&aelig; August&aelig;,"
that he has read Lampridius, Suetonius, and the
others, but he does not strive to make us aware of
it. The historical form has at last found a poet
to render it supportable. Blood runs across the
pages; gore and booty are the principal themes;
and yet Beauty struts supreme through the horror.
The author's sympathy is his password, a
sympathy which he occasionally exposes, for he
is not above pinning his heart to his sleeve, as, for
example, when he says, "In spite of Augustus's
boast, the city was not by any means of marble.
It was filled with crooked little streets, with the
atrocities of the Tarquins, with houses unsightly
and perilous, with the moss and dust of ages; it
compared with Alexandria as London compares
with Paris; it had a splendour of its own, but a
splendour that could be heightened." Here is a
picture of squalid Rome: "In the subura, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
at night women sat in high chairs, ogling the
passer with painted eyes, there was still plenty of
brick; tall tenements, soiled linen, the odor of
Whitechapel and St. Giles. The streets were noisy
with match-pedlars, with vendors of cake and
tripe and coke; there were touts there too, altars
to unimportant divinities, lying Jews who dealt in
old clothes, in obscene pictures and unmentionable
wares; at the crossings there were thimbleriggers,
clowns and jugglers, who made glass balls appear
and disappear surprisingly; there were doorways
decorated with curious invitations, gossipy barber
shops, where, through the liberality of politicians,
the scum of a great city was shaved, curled and
painted free; and there were public houses, where
vagabond slaves and sexless priests drank the
mulled wine of Crete, supped on the flesh of beasts
slaughtered in the arena, or watched the Syrian
women twist to the click of castanets." The account
of the arena under Nero should not be
missed, but it is too long to quote here. The
book, which we give three stars, is dedicated to
Edwin Albert Schroeder. Fortunately, of all Saltus's
works, it is the most readily procurable.</p>

<p>"Imperial Purple" has had a curious history.
Belford, Clarke and Co., who hid their identity
behind the "Morrill, Higgins" imprint, failed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
shortly after they had issued the book. "Presently,"
Mr. Saltus writes me, "a Chicago bibliofilou
brought it out as the work of some one else
and called it 'The Sins of Nero.'" Meanwhile
Greening published it in London and finally
Mitchell Kennerley reprinted it in New York.
In 1911 Macmillan in London brought out "The
Amazing Emperor Heliogabolus" by the Reverend
John Stuart Hay of Oxford. In the preface
to this book I found the following: "I have
also the permission of Mr. E. E. Saltus of Harvard
University (<i>sic</i>) to quote his vivid and beautiful
studies on the Roman Empire and her customs.
I am also deeply indebted to Mr. Walter
Pater, Mr. J. A. Symonds, and Mr. Saltus for
many a <i>tournure de phrase</i> and picturesque rendering
of Tacitus, Suetonious, Lampridius, and the
rest." The Reverend Doctor certainly helped
himself to "Imperial Purple." Words, sentences,
nay whole paragraphs appear without the formality
of quotation marks, without any indication,
indeed, save these lines in the preface, that they
are not part of the Doctor's own imagination,
unless one compares them with the style in which
the rest of the book is written. "In one instance,"
Mr. Saltus writes me, "he gave a paragraph
of mine as his own. Later on he added,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
'as we have already said' and repeated the paragraph.
The plural struck me as singular."</p>

<p>"Madam Sapphira"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> is a vivid study in unchastened
womanhood. We see but little of the
lady in the 251 pages of this "Fifth Avenue
Story"; her character is exposed to us through
the experiences of her poor fool husband, who
colloquially would be called a simp, by denizens of
the Low World a boob. He redeems himself to
some extent by sending Madam Sapphira a belated
bouquet of cyanide of potassium. On the whole,
though characters and phrases in his work might
be brought forward to prove the contrary, Mr.
Saltus obviously has a low opinion of women and
thinks that men do better without them. The
greater part of the time he appears to agree with
Posthumus:</p>

<p>"Enthralled, a story of international life setting
forth the curious circumstances concerning
Lord Cloden and Oswald Quain":<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> a mad <i>opus</i>
this, an insane phantasmagoria of crime, avarice,
and murder. For the second time in this author's
novels incest plays a r&ocirc;le. This time it is real.
Quain is indeed the half-brother of the lady who
desires to marry him. He is as vile and virulent
a villain as any who stalks through the pages of
Ann Ker, Eliza Bromley, or Mrs. Radcliffe. A
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde motive is sounded. An
ugly man comes back from London a handsome
fellow after visits to a certain doctor who rearranges
the lines of his face. The transformation
is effected every day now (some of our
prominent actresses are said to have benefited by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
this operation), but in 1894 the mechanism of
the trick must have been appallingly creaky.
This story, indeed, borders on the burlesque and
has almost as much claim to the title as "The
Green Carnation." Was the author laughing at
the Eighteen Nineties? The period is subtly
evoked in one detail, constantly reiterated in Saltus's
early books: ladies and gentlemen when they
leave a room "push aside the portieres." Sometimes
the "rings jingle." He has in most instances
mercifully spared us further descriptions
of the interiors of New York houses at this
epoch.... At a dinner party one of the guests
refers to Howells as the "foremost novelist who is
never read." The book is dedicated to "Cherubina,
<i>dulcissime rerum</i>." Saltus returned to the
central theme of "Enthralled" in a story called
"The Impostor," printed in "Ainslee's" for May,
1917.</p>

<p>"When Dreams Come True"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> again brings us
in touch with Tancred Ennever, the stupid hero
of "The Transient Guest." In the meantime he
has become an almost intolerable prig. It is
probable that Saltus meant more by this fable
than he has let appear. The roar of the waves
on the coast of Lesbos is distinctly audible for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
time and the d&eacute;no&ucirc;ment seems to belong to quite
another story.... Ennever has turned author.
We are informed that he has completed studies on
Huysmans and Leconte de Lisle; he is also engaged
on a "Historia Amoris." There is an interesting
passage relating to the names of great
writers. Alphabet Jones assures us that they are
always "in two syllables with the accent on the
first. Oyez: Homer, Sappho, Horace, Dante,
Petrarch, Ronsard, Shakespeare, Hugo, Swinburne
... Balzac, Flaubert, Huysmans, Michelet,
Renan." The reader is permitted to
add ... "Saltus"!</p>

<p>"Purple and Fine Women"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> is a misnamed
book. It should be called "Philosophic Fables."
The first two stories are French in form. Paul
Bourget himself is the hero of one of them! In
"The Princess of the Sun" we are offered a new
and fantastic version of the Coppelia story.
"The Dear Departed" finds Saltus in a murderous
amorous mood again. In "The Princess
of the Golden Isles" a new poison is introduced,
muscarine. Alchemy furnishes the theme for one
tale; the protagonist seeks an alcahest, a human
victim for his crucible. We are left in doubt as
to whether he chooses his wife, who wears a diamond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
set in one of her teeth, or a gorilla. There
are dramas of dual personality and of death.
Metaphysics and spiritualism rise dimly out of the
charm of this book. There is a duchess who mews
like a cat and somewhere we are assured that
<i>Perche non posso odiarte</i> from <i>La Sonnnambula</i> is
the most beautiful aria in the Italian repertory.
Here is a true and soul-revealing epigram:
"The best way to master a subject of which you
are ignorant is to write it up." Certainly not
Saltus at his best, this <i>opus</i>, but far from his
worst.</p>

<p>"The Perfume of Eros"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> is frenzied fiction
again; amnesia, drunkenness, white slavery, sex,
are its mingled themes. There is a pretty picture,
recognizable in any smart community, of a witty
woman of fashion, and a full-length portrait of a
bounder. "The Yellow Fay," Saltus's <i>clich&eacute;</i> for
the Demon Rum, was the original title of this
"Fifth Avenue Incident." Romance and Realism
consort lovingly together in its pages. There is
an unforgetable passage descriptive of a young
man ridding himself of his mistress. He interrupts
his flow of explanation to hand her a card
case, which she promptly throws out of the window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"'That is an agreeable way of getting rid of
twelve thousand dollars,' he remarked.</p>

<p>"Yet, however lightly he affected to speak, the
action annoyed him. Like all men of large means
he was close. It seemed to him beastly to lose
such a sum. He got up, went to the window and
looked down. He could not see the case and he
much wanted to go and look for it. But that for
the moment Marie prevented."</p>

<p>"The Pomps of Satan"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> is replete with grace
and graciousness, and full of charm, a quality more
valuable to its possessor than juvenility, our author
tells us in a chapter concerning the lost elixir
of youth. Neither form nor matter assume ponderous
shape in this volume, which in the quality
of its contents reminds one faintly of Franz Blei's
lady's breviary, "The Powder Puff," but Saltus's
book is the more ingratiating of the two. Satan's
pomps are varied; the author exposes his whims,
his ideas, images the past, forecasts the future, deplores
the present. There is a chapter on cooking
and we learn that Saltus does not care for
food prepared in the German style ... nor yet
in the American. He forbids us champagne:
"Champagne is not a wine. It is a beverage,
lighter indeed than brandy and soda, but, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
cologne, fit only for demi-reps." But he seems
untrue to himself in an essay condemning the use
of perfumes. His own books are heavily scented.
With the rare prescience and clairvoyance of an
artist he includes the German Kaiser in a chapter
on hyenas (in 1906!); therein stalk the blood-stained
shadows of Caligula, Caracalla, Atilla,
Tamerlane, Cesare Borgia, Philip II, and Ivan
the Terrible. The paragraph is worth quoting:
"Power consists in having a million bayonets behind
you. Its diffusion is not general. But there
are people who possess it. For one, the German
Kaiser. Not long since somebody or other diagnosed
in him the habitual criminal. We doubt
that he is that. But we suspect that, were it not
for the press, he would show more of primitive man
than he has thus far thought judicious." Has
Mme. de Th&egrave;bes done better? Saltus also foresaw
Gertrude Stein. Peering into the future he
wrote: "When that day comes the models of literary
excellence will not be the long and windy
sentences of accredited bores, but ample brevities,
such as the 'N' on Napoleon's tomb, in which, in
less than a syllable, an epoch, and the glory of it,
is resumed." Saltus forsakes his previous choice
from Bellini and installs <i>Tu che a Dio</i> as his favourite
Italian opera air. Here is another flash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of self-revealment: "Byzance is rumoured to
have been the sewer of every sin, yet such was its
beauty that it is the canker of our heart we could
not have lived there." Always this turning to the
far past, this delving in rosetta stones and palimpsests,
this preoccupation with the sights and sins
of the ancient gods and kings. A chapter on
poisons, another on Gille de Retz, which probably
owes something to "La Bas," betray this preference.
He playfully suggests that the Academy of
Arts and Letters be filled up with young nobodies:
"They have, indeed, done nothing yet. But
therein is their charm. An academy composed of
young people who have done nothing yet would be
more alluring than one made up of fossils who are
unable to do anything more." Herein are contained
enough aphorisms and epigrams to make
up a new book of Solomonic wisdom. Hardly as
evenly inspired as "Imperial Purple," "The
Pomps of Satan" is more dashing and more
varied. It is also more tired.</p>

<p>"Vanity Square"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in Stella Sixmuth boasts
such a "vampire" as even Theda Bara is seldom
called upon to portray. Not until the final chapters
of this mystery story do we discover that
this lady has been poisoning a rich man's wife,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with an eye on the rich man's heart and hand.
Oraere is this slow and subtle poison which leaves
no subsequent trace. She is thwarted but in a
subsequent attempt she is successful. Robert
Hichens has used this theme in "Bella Donna."
There is a suicide by pistol. An exciting story
but little else, this book contains fewer references
to the gods and the c&aelig;sars than is usual with
Saltus. To compensate there are long discussions
about phobias, dual personalities (a girl with six
is described) and theories about future existence.
Vanity Square, we are told, is bounded by Central
Park, Madison Avenue, Seventy-second Street and
the Plaza.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Tancred Ennever
was at work on "Historia Amoris"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in 1895,
which would seem to indicate that Saltus had begun
to collect material for it himself at that time.
The title is a literal description of the contents of
the book: it is a history of love. Such a work
might have been made purely anecdotal or scientific,
but Saltus's purpose has been at once more
serious and more graceful, to show how the love
currents flowed through the centuries, to show what
effect period life had on love and what effect love
had on period life. Beginning with Babylon and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
passing on through the "Song of Songs" we meet
Helen of Troy, Scheherazade (though but briefly),
Sappho (to whom an entire chapter is devoted),
Cleopatra (whom Heine called "<i>cette reine entretenue</i>"),
Mary Magdalen, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se.... The
Courts of Love are described and deductions are
drawn as to the effect of the Renaissance on the
Gay Science. "Historia Amoris" is concluded by
a Schopenhauerian essay on "The Law of Attraction."
Cicisbeism is not treated in extenso, as it
should be, and I also missed the fragrant name
of Sophie Arnould. Readers of "Love and Lore,"
"The Pomps of Satan," "Imperial Purple," and
"The Lords of the Ghostland" will find much of
their material adjusted to the purposes of this
History of Love, which, nevertheless, no one interested
in Saltus can afford to miss.</p>

<p>In "The Lords of the Ghostland, a history of
the ideal,"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Saltus returns to the theme of "The
Anatomy of Negation." The newer work is both
more cynical and more charming. It is, of course,
a history and a comparison of religions. With
Reinach Saltus believes that Christianity owes
much to its ancestors. Brahma, Ormuzd, Amon-R&acirc;,
Bel-Marduk, Jehovah, Zeus, Jupiter, and
many lesser deities parade before us in defile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Prejudice, intolerance, tolerance even are lacking
from this book, as they were from "Imperial
Purple." "The Lords of the Ghostland" is
neither reverent nor irreverent, it is unreverent.
Mr. Saltus finds joy in writing about the gods, the
joy of a poet, and if his chiefest pleasure is to
extol the gods of Greece that is only what might
be expected of this truly pagan spirit. Students
of comparative theology can learn much from
these pages, but they will learn it unwittingly, for
the poet supersedes the teacher. Saltus is never
professorial. The scientific spirit is never to the
fore; no marshalling of dull facts for their own
sakes. Nevertheless I suspect that the book contains
more absorbing information than any similar
volume on the subject. With a fascinating and
guileful style this divine devil of an author leads us
on to the spot where he can point out to us that
the only original feature of Christianity is the
crucifixion, and even that is foreshadowed in
Hindoo legend, in which Krishna dies, nailed by
arrows to a tree. This book should be required
reading for the first class in isogogies.</p>

<p>Most of the scenes of "Daughters of the
Rich"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> are laid in Paris. The plot hinges on mistaken
identity and the whole is a very ingenious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
detective story. The book begins rather than
ends with a murder, but that is because the tale
is told backward. Through lies, deceit, and
treachery the woman in the case, one Sallie Malakoff,
betrays the hero into marriage with her.
When he discovers her perfidy he cheerfully cuts
her throat from ear to ear and goes to join the
lady from whom he has been estranged. She receives
him with open arms and suggests wedding
bells. No woman, she asserts, could resist a man
who has killed another woman for her sake. This
is decidedly a Roman point of view! Some of the
action takes place in a house on the Avenue Malakoff,
which must have been near the <i>h&ocirc;tel</i> of the
Princesse de Sagan and the apartment occupied
by Miss Mary Garden.... A fat manufacturer's
wife confronts the proposal of a mercenary duke
with an epic rejoinder: "Pay a man a million
dollars to sleep with my daughter! Never!"...
Again Saltus demonstrates how completely he is
master of the story-telling gift, how surely he possesses
the power to compel breathless attention.</p>

<p>"The Monster"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is fiction, incredible, insane
fiction. The monster is incest, in this instance
<i>inceste manqu&eacute;</i> because it doesn't come off. On
the eve of a runaway marriage Leilah Ogsten is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
informed by her father that her intended husband
is her own brother (he inculpates her mother in the
scandal). Leilah disappears and to put barriers
between her and the man she loves becomes the
bride of another. Verplank pursues. There are
two fabulous duels and a scene in which our hero
is mangled by dogs. The stage (for we are always
in some extravagant theatre) is frequently set in
Paris and the familiar scenes of the capital are in
turn exposed to our view. It is all mad, full of
purple patches and crimson splotches and yet, once
opened, it is impossible to lay the book down
until it is completed. From this novel Mr. Saltus
fashioned his only play, <i>The Gates of Life</i>, which
he sent to Charles Frohman and which Mr. Frohman
returned. The piece has neither been produced
nor published.</p>

<p>Last year (1917) the Brothers of the Book in
Chicago published privately an extremely limited
edition (474 copies) of a book by Edgar Saltus
entitled, "Oscar Wilde: An Idler's Impression,"
which contains only twenty-six pages, but those
twenty-six pages are very beautiful. They evoke
a spirit from the dead. Indeed, I doubt if even
Saltus has done better than his description of a
strange occurrence in a Regent Street Restaurant
on a certain night when he was supping with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Wilde and Wilde was reading <i>Salome</i> to him:
"apropos of nothing, or rather with what to me at
the time was curious irrelevance, Oscar, while tossing
off glass after glass of liquor, spoke of Ph&eacute;m&eacute;,
a goddess rare even in mythology, who after appearing
twice in Homer, flashed through a verse of
Hesiod and vanished behind a page of Herodotus.
In telling of her, suddenly his eyes lifted, his
mouth contracted, a spasm of pain&mdash;or was it
dread?&mdash;had gripped him. A moment only.
His face relaxed. It had gone.</p>

<p>"I have since wondered, could he have evoked
the goddess then? For Ph&eacute;m&eacute; typified what modern
occultism terms the impact&mdash;the premonition
that surges and warns. It was Wilde's fate to die
three times&mdash;to die in the dock, to die in prison,
to die all along the boulevards of Paris. Often
since I have wondered could the goddess have been
lifting, however slightly, some fringe of the crimson
curtain, behind which, in all its horror, his
destiny crouched. If so, he braved it.</p>

<p>"I had looked away. I looked again. Before
me was a fat pauper, florid and over-dressed, who,
in the voice of an immortal, was reading the fantasies
of the damned. In his hand was a manuscript,
and we were supping on <i>Salome</i>."</p>

<p>Edgar Saltus began with Balzac in 1884 and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
he has reached Oscar Wilde in 1917. His other
literary essays, on Gautier and M&eacute;rim&eacute;e in "Tales
Before Supper," on Barbey d'Aurevilly in "The
Story Without a Name," and on Victor Hugo in
"The Forum" (June, 1912,) all display the finest
qualities of his genius. Pervaded with his rare
charm they are clairvoyant and illuminating, more
than that arresting. They should be brought together
in one volume, especially as they are at
present absolutely inaccessible, terrifyingly so,
every one of them. And if they are to be thus
collected may we not hope for one or two new essays
with, say, for subjects, Flaubert and Huysmans?</p>

<p>It is, you may perceive, as an essayist, a historian,
an amateur philosopher that Saltus excels,
but his fiction should not be underrated on
that account. His novels indeed are half essays,
just as his essays are half novels. Even the worst
of them contains charming pages, delightful and
unexpected interruptions. His series of fables
suggests a vast <i>Com&eacute;die Inhumaine</i> but this statement
must not be regarded as dispraise: it is
merely description. You will find something of
the same quality in the work of Edgar Allan Poe,
but Saltus has more grace and charm than Poe,
if less intensity. After one dip into realism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
("Mr. Incoul's Misadventure") Saltus became an
incorrigible romantic. All his characters are the
inventions of an errant fancy; scarcely one of
them suggests a human being, but they are none
the less creations of art. This, perhaps, was a
daring procedure in an era devoted to the exploitation
in fiction of the facts of hearth and home....
After all, however, his way may be the better
way. Personally I may say that my passion for
realism is on the wane.</p>

<p>In these strange tales we pass through the
familiar haunts of metropolitan life, but the creatures
are amazingly unfamiliar. They have horns
and hoofs, halos and wings, or fins and tails. An
esoteric band of fabulous monsters these: harpies
and vampires take tea at Sherry's; succubi and
incubbi are observed buying opal rings at Tiffany's;
fairies, angels, dwarfs, and elves, bearing
branches of asphodel, trip lightly down Waverly
Place; peris, amshaspahands, &aelig;sir, izeds, and goblins
sleep at the Brevoort; seraphim and cherubim
decorate drawing rooms on Irving Place; griffons,
chimeras, and sphynxes take courses in philosophy
at Harvard; willis and sylphs sing airs
from <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i> and <i>Le Nozze di
Figaro</i>; naiads and mermaids embark on the
Cunard Line; centaurs and amazons drive in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Florentine Cascine; kobolds, gnomes, and trolls
stab, shoot, and poison one another; and a satyr
meets the martichoras in Gramercy Park. No
such pictures of monstrous, diverting, sensuous
existence can be found elsewhere save in the paintings
of Arnold B&ouml;cklin, Franz von Stuck, and
above all those of Gustave Moreau. If he had
done nothing else Edgar Saltus should be famous
for having given New York a mythology of its
own!</p>

<h2><a name="The_New_Art_of_the_Singer" id="The_New_Art_of_the_Singer"></a>The New Art of the Singer</h2>


<p>The art of vocalization is retarding the
progress of the modern music drama.
That is the simple fact although, doubtless,
you are as accustomed as I am to hearing it expressed
<i>&agrave; rebours</i>. How many times have we read
that the art of singing is in its decadence, that
soon there would not be one artist left fitted to
deliver vocal music in public. The Earl of Mount
Edgcumbe wrote something of the sort in 1825
for he found the great Catalani but a sorry travesty
of his early favourites, Pacchierotti and
Banti. I protest against this misconception.
Any one who asserts that there are laws which
govern singing, physical, scientific laws, must pay
court to other ears than mine. I have heard this
same man for twenty years shouting in the market
place that a piece without action was not a play
(usually the drama he referred to had more real
action than that which decorates the progress of
<i>Nellie, the Beautiful Cloak Model</i>), that a composition
without melody (meaning something by
Richard Wagner, Robert Franz, or even Edvard
Grieg) was not music, that verse without rhyme
was not poetry. This same type of brilliant mind
will go on to aver (forgetting the Scot) that men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
who wear skirts are not men, (forgetting the Spaniards)
that women who smoke cigars are not
women, and to settle numberless other matters in
so silly a manner that a ten year old, half-witted
school boy, after three minutes light thinking,
could be depended upon to do better.</p>

<p>The rules for the art of singing, laid down in
the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, have
become obsolete. How could it be otherwise?
They were contrived to fit a certain style of composition.
We have but the briefest knowledge, indeed,
of how people sang before 1700, although
records exist praising the performances of Archilei
and others. If a different standard for the criticism
of vocalization existed before 1600 there is
no reason why there should not after 1917. As
a matter of fact, maugre much authoritative opinion
to the contrary, a different standard does exist.
In certain respects the new standard is taken
for granted. We do not, for example, expect to
hear male sopranos at the opera. The Earl of
Mount Edgcumbe admired this artificial form of
voice almost to the exclusion of all others. His
favourite singer, indeed, Pacchierotti, was a male
soprano. But other breaks have been made with
tradition, breaks which are not yet taken for
granted. When you find that all but one or two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of the singers in every opera house in the world
are ignoring the rules in some respect or other you
may be certain, in spite of the protests of the
professors, that the rules are dead. Their excuse
has disappeared and they remain only as silly
commandments made to fit an old religion. A
singer in Handel's day was accustomed to stand
in one spot on the stage and sing; nothing else
was required of him. He was not asked to walk
about or to act; even expression in his singing
was limited to pathos. The singers of this period,
Nicolini, Senesino, Cuzzoni, Faustina, Caffarelli,
Farinelli, Carestini, Gizziello, and Pacchierotti,
devoted their study years to preparing their voices
for the display of a certain definite kind of florid
music. They had nothing else to learn. As a
consequence they were expected to be particularly
efficient. Porpora, Caffarelli's teacher, is said to
have spent six years on his pupil before he sent
him forth to be "the greatest singer in the world."
Contemporary critics appear to have been highly
pleased with the result but there is some excuse
for H. T. Finck's impatience, expressed in "Songs
and Song Writers": "The favourites of the
eighteenth-century Italian audiences were artificial
male sopranos, like Farinelli, who was frantically
applauded for such circus tricks as beating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
a trumpeter in holding on to a note, or racing
with an orchestra and getting ahead of it; or
Caffarelli, who entertained his audiences by singing,
<i>in one breath</i>, a chromatic chain of trills up
and down two octaves. Caffarelli was a pupil of
the famous vocal teacher Porpora, who wrote
operas consisting chiefly of monotonous successions
of florid arias resembling the music that is
now written for flutes and violins." All very well
for the day, no doubt, but could Cuzzoni sing
Isolde? Could Faustina sing M&eacute;lisande? And
what modern parts would be allotted to the Julian
Eltinges of the Eighteenth Century?</p>

<p>When composers began to set dramatic texts
to music trouble immediately appeared at the door.
For example, the contemporaries of Sophie
Arnould, the "creator" of <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Aulide</i>,
are agreed that she was greater as an actress than
she was as a singer. David Garrick, indeed, pronounced
her a finer actress than Clairon. From
that day to this there has been a continual triangular
conflict between critic, composer, and
singer, which up to date, it must be admitted, has
been won by the academic pundits, for, although
the singer has struggled, she has generally bent
under the blows of the critical knout, thereby
holding the lyric drama more or less in the state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
it was in a hundred years ago (every critic and
almost every composer will tell you that any modern
opera can be sung according to the laws of
<i>bel canto</i> and enough singers exist, unfortunately,
to justify this assertion) save that the music is
not so well sung, according to the old standards,
as it was then. No singer has had quite the courage
to entirely defy tradition, to refuse to study
with a teacher, to embody her own natural ideas
in the performance of music, to found a new school
... but there have been many rebells.</p>

<p>The operas of Mozart, Bellini, Donizetti, and
Rossini, as a whole, do not demand great histrionic
exertion from their interpreters and for a time
singers trained in the old Handelian tradition met
every requirement of these composers and their
audiences. If more action was demanded than
in Handel's day the newer music, in compensation,
was easier to sing. But even early in the Nineteenth
Century we observe that those artists who
strove to be actors as well as singers lost something
in vocal facility (really they were pushing
on to the new technique). I need only speak of
Ronconi and Mme. Pasta. The lady was admittedly
the greatest lyric artist of her day although
it is recorded that her slips from true intonation
were frequent. When she could no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
longer command a steady tone the <i>beaux restes</i>
of her art and her authoritative style caused
Pauline Viardot, who was hearing her then for
the first time, to burst into tears. Ronconi's
voice, according to Chorley, barely exceeded an
octave; it was weak and habitually out of tune.
This baritone was not gifted with vocal agility
and he was monotonous in his use of ornament.
Nevertheless this same Chorley admits that Ronconi
afforded him more pleasure in the theatre
than almost any other singer he ever heard! If
this critic did not rise to the occasion here and
point the way to the future in another place he
had a faint glimmering of the coming revolution:
"There might, there <i>should</i> be yet, a new <i>Medea</i>
as an opera. Nothing can be grander, more antique,
more Greek, than Cherubini's setting of the
'grand fiendish part' (to quote the words of
Mrs. Siddons on Lady Macbeth). But, as music,
it becomes simply impossible to be executed, so
frightful is the strain on the energies of her who
is to present the heroine. Compared with this
character, Beethoven's Leonora, Weber's Euryanthe,
are only so much child's play." This is
topsy-turvy reasoning, of course, but at the same
time it is suggestive.</p>

<p>The modern orchestra dug a deeper breach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
between the two schools. Wagner called upon
the singer to express powerful emotion, passionate
feeling, over a great body of sound, nay, in many
instances, <i>against</i> a great body of sound. (It is
significant that Wagner himself admitted that it
was a singer [Madame Schroeder-Devrient] who
revealed to him the possibilities of dramatic singing.
He boasted that he was the only one to
learn the lesson. "She was the first artist,"
writes H. T. Finck, "who fully revealed the fact
that in a dramatic opera there may be situations
where <i>characteristic</i> singing is of more importance
than <i>beautiful</i> singing.") It is small occasion
for wonder that singers began to bark. Indeed
they nearly expired under the strain of trying
successfully to mingle Porpora and passion. According
to W. F. Apthorp, Max Alvary once said
that, considering the emotional intensity of music
and situations, the constant co-operation of the
surging orchestra, and, most of all, the unconquerable
feeling of the reality of it all, it was a
wonder that singing actors did not go stark mad,
before the very faces of the audience, in parts like
Tristan or Siegfried.... The critics, however,
were inexorable; they stood by their guns. There
was but one way to sing the new music and that
was the way of Bernacchi and Pistocchi. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
time, by dint of persevering, talking night and
day, writing day and night, they convinced the
singer. The music drama developed but the singer
was held in his place. Some artists, great geniuses,
of course, made the compromise successfully....
Jean de Reszke, for example, and Lilli Lehmann,
who said to H. E. Krehbiel ("Chapters of
Opera"): "It is easier to sing all three Br&uuml;nnhildes
than one Norma. You are so carried away
by the dramatic emotion, the action, and the scene,
that you do not have to think how to sing the
words. That comes of itself" ... but they
made the further progress of the composer more
difficult thereby; music remained merely pretty.
The successors of these supple singers even learned
to sing Richard Strauss with broad cantilena effects.
As for Puccini! At a performance of
<i>Madama Butterfly</i> a Japanese once asked why
the singers were producing those nice round tones
in moments of passion; why not ugly sounds?</p>

<p>Will any composer arise with the courage to
write an opera which <i>cannot</i> be sung? Stravinsky
almost did this in <i>The Nightingale</i> but the break
must be more complete. Think of the range of
sounds made by the Japanese, the gipsy, the Chinese,
the Spanish folk-singers. The newest composer
may ask for shrieks, squeaks, groans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
screams, a thousand delicate shades of guttural
and falsetto vocal tones from his interpreters.
Why should the gamut of expression on our opera
stage be so much more limited than it is in our
music halls? Why should the Hottentots be able
to make so many delightful noises that we are incapable
of producing? Composers up to date
have taken into account a singer's apparent inability
to bridge difficult intervals. It is only by
ignoring all such limitations that the new music
will definitely emerge, the new art of the singer
be born. What marvellous effects might be
achieved by skipping from octave to octave in
the human voice! When will the obfusc pundits
stop shouting for what Avery Hopwood calls
"ascending and descending tetrarchs!"</p>

<p>But, some one will argue, with the passing of
<i>bel canto</i> what will become of the operas of Mozart,
Bellini, Rossini, and Donizetti? Who will sing
them? Fear not, lover of the golden age of song,
<i>bel canto</i> is not passing as swiftly as that. Singers
will continue to be born into this world who
are able to cope with the floridity of this music, for
they are born, not made. Amelita Galli-Curci
will have her successors, just as Adelina Patti
had hers. Singers of this kind begin to sing
naturally in their infancy and they continue to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
sing, just sing.... One touch of drama or emotion
and their voices disappear. Remember Nellie
Melba's sad experience with <i>Siegfried</i>. The
great Mario had scarcely studied singing (one
authority says that he had taken a few lessons
of Meyerbeer!) when he made his d&eacute;but in <i>Robert,
le Diable</i> and there is no evidence that he studied
very much afterwards. Melba, herself, spent less
than a year with Mme. Marchesi in preparation
for her opera career. Mme. Galli-Curci asserts
that she has had very little to do with professors
and I do not think Mme. Tetrazzini passed her
youth in mastering <i>vocalizzi</i>. As a matter of fact
she studied singing only six months. Adelina
Patti told Dr. Hanslick that she had sung <i>Una
voce poco f&agrave;</i> at the age of seven with the same
embellishments which she used later when she appeared
in the opera in which the air occurs. No,
these singers are freaks of nature like tortoise-shell
cats and like those rare felines they are
usually females of late, although such singers as
Battistini and Bonci remind us that men once sang
with as much agility as women. But when this
type of singer finally becomes extinct naturally
the operas which depend on it will disappear too
for the same reason that the works of Monteverde
and Handel have dropped out of the repertory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
that the Greek tragedies and the Elizabethan interludes
are no longer current on our stage.
None of our actors understands the style of Chinese
plays; consequently it would be impossible to
present one of them in our theatre. As Deirdre
says in Synge's great play, "It's a heartbreak
to the wise that it's for a short space we have
the same things only." We cannot, indeed, have
everything. No one doubts that the plays of
&AElig;schylus, Euripides, and Sophocles are great
dramas; the operas I have just referred to can
also be admired in the closet and probably they
will be. Even today no more than two works of
Rossini, the most popular composer of the early
Nineteenth Century, are to be heard. What has
become of <i>Semiramide</i>, <i>La Cenerentola</i>, and the
others? There are no singers to sing them and
so they have been dropped from the repertory
without being missed. Can any of our young
misses hum <i>Di Tanti Palpiti</i>? You know they
cannot. I doubt if you can find two girls in New
York (and I mean girls with a musical education)
who can tell you in what opera the air belongs
and yet in the early Twenties this tune was as
popular as <i>Un Bel Di</i> is today.</p>

<p>Coloratura singing has been called heartless, not
altogether without reason. At one time its <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>exemplars
fired composers to their best efforts.
That day has passed. That day passed seventy
years ago. It may occur to you that there is
something wrong when singers of a certain type
can only find the proper means to exploit their
voices in works of the past, operas which are dead.
It is to be noted that Nellie Melba and Amelita
Galli-Curci are absolutely unfitted to sing in music
dramas even so early as those of Richard Wagner;
Dukas, Strauss, and Stravinsky are utterly beyond
them. Even Adelina Patti and Marcella
Sembrich appeared in few, if any, new works of
importance. They had no bearing on the march
of musical history. Here is an entirely paradoxical
situation; a set of interpreters who exist,
it would seem, only for the purpose of delivering
to us the art of the past. What would we think
of an actor who could make no effect save in the
tragedies of Corneille? It is such as these who
have kept Leo Ornstein from writing an opera.
Berlioz forewarned us in his "Memoirs." He was
one of the first to foresee the coming day: "We
shall always find a fair number of female singers,
popular from their brilliant singing of brilliant
trifles, and odious to the great masters because
utterly incapable of properly interpreting
them. They have voices, a certain knowledge of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
music, and flexible throats: they are lacking in
soul, brain, and heart. Such women are regular
monsters and all the more formidable to composers
because they are often charming monsters. This
explains the weakness of certain masters in writing
falsely sentimental parts, which attract the
public by their brilliancy. It also explains the
number of degenerate works, the gradual degradation
of style, the destruction of all sense of expression,
the neglect of dramatic properties, the
contempt for the true, the grand, and the beautiful,
and the cynicism and decrepitude of art in
certain countries."</p>

<p>So, even if, as the ponderous criticasters are
continually pointing out, the age of <i>bel canto</i> is
really passing there is no actual occasion for grief.
All fashions in art pass and what is known as <i>bel
canto</i> is just as much a fashion as the bombastic
style of acting that prevailed in Victor Hugo's
day or the "realistic" style of acting we prefer
today. All interpretative art is based primarily
on the material with which it deals and with contemporary
public taste. This kind of singing is
a direct derivative of a certain school of opera
and as that school of opera is fading more expressive
methods of singing are coming to the
fore. The very first principle of <i>bel canto</i>, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
equalized scale, is a false one. With an equalized
scale a singer can produce a perfectly ordered
series of notes, a charming string of matched
pearls, but nothing else. It is worthy of note
that it is impossible to sing Spanish or negro
folk-songs with an equalized scale. Almost all
folk-music, indeed, exacts a vocal method of its
interpreter quite distinct from that of the art
song.</p>

<p>We know now that true beauty lies deeper than
in the emission of "perfect tone." Beauty is
truth and expressiveness. The new art of the
singer should develop to the highest degree the
significance of the text. Calv&eacute; once said that she
did not become a real artist until she forgot that
she had a beautiful voice and thought only of the
proper expression the music demanded.</p>

<p>Of the old method of singing only one quality
will persist in the late Twentieth Century (mind
you, this is deliberate prophecy but it is about as
safe as it would be to predict that Sarah Bernhardt
will live to give several hundred more performances
of <i>La Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias</i>) and that is
style. The performance of any work demands a
knowledge of and a feeling for its style but style
is about the last thing a singer ever studies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
When, however, you find a singer who understands
style, there you have an artist!</p>

<p>Style is the quality which endures long after
the singer has lost the power to produce a pure
tone or to contrive accurate phrasing and so
makes it possible for artists to hold their places
on the stage long after their voices have become
partially defective or, indeed, have actually departed.
It is knowledge of style that accounts
for the long careers of Marcella Sembrich and
Lilli Lehmann or of Yvette Guilbert and Maggie
Cline for that matter. It is knowledge of style
that makes De Wolf Hopper a great artist in his
interpretation of the music of Sullivan and the
words of Gilbert. Some artists, indeed, with
barely a shred of voice, have managed to maintain
their positions on the stage for many years
through a knowledge of style. I might mention
Victor Maurel, Max Heinrich (not on the opera
stage, of course), Antonio Scotti, and Maurice
Renaud.</p>

<p>A singer may be born with the ability to produce
pure tones (I doubt if Mme. Melba learned
much about tone production from her teachers),
she may even phrase naturally, although this is
more doubtful, but the acquirement of style is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
long and tedious process and one which generally
requires specialization. For style is elusive. An
auditor, a critic, will recognize it at once but
very few can tell of what it consists. Nevertheless
it is fairly obvious to the casual listener that
Olive Fremstad is more at home in the music
dramas of Gluck and Wagner than she is in <i>Carmen</i>
and <i>Tosca</i>, and that Marcella Sembrich is
happier when she is singing Zerlina (as a Mozart
singer she has had no equal in the past three
decades) than when she is singing <i>Lakm&eacute;</i>. Mme.
Melba sings <i>Lucia</i> in excellent style but she probably
could not convince us that she knows how to
sing a Brahms song. So far as I know she has
never tried to do so. A recent example comes
to mind in Maria Marco, the Spanish soprano, who
sings music of her own country in her own language
with absolutely irresistible effect, but on
one occasion when she attempted <i>Vissi d'Arte</i> she
was transformed immediately into a second-rate
Italian singer. Even her gestures, ordinarily
fully of grace and meaning, had become conventionalized.</p>

<p>If this quality of style (which after all means an
understanding of both the surface manner and
underlying purpose of a composition and an ability
to transmit this understanding across the footlights)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
is of such manifest importance in the
field of art music it is doubly so in the field of
popular or folk-music. A foreigner had best
think twice before attempting to sing a Swedish
song, a Hungarian song, or a Polish song, popular
or folk. (According to no less an authority
than Cecil J. Sharp, the peasants themselves differentiate
between the two and devote to each a
<i>special vocal method</i>. Here are his words ["English
Folk-Song"]: "But, it must be remembered
that the vocal method of the folk-singer is inseparable
from the folk-song. It is a cult which
has grown up side by side with the folk-song, and
is, no doubt, part and parcel of the same tradition.
When, for instance, an old singing man sings a
modern popular song, he will sing it in quite another
way. The tone of his voice will change and
he will slur his intervals, after the approved manner
of the street-singer. Indeed, it is usually
quite possible to detect a genuine folk-song simply
by paying attention to the way in which it is
sung.") Strangers as a rule do not attempt such
matters although we have before us at the present
time the very interesting case of Ratan Devi.
It is a question, however, if Ratan Devi would be
so much admired if her songs or their traditional
manner of performance were more familiar to us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>On our music hall stage there are not more than
ten singers who understand how to sing American
popular songs (and these, as I have said elsewhere
at some length,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> constitute America's best claim
in the art of music). It is very difficult to sing
them well. Tone and phrasing have nothing to
do with the matter; it is all a question of style
(leaving aside for the moment the important matter
of personality which enters into an accounting
for any artist's popularity or standing).
Elsie Janis, a very clever mimic, a delightful
dancer, and perhaps the most deservedly popular
artist on our music hall stage, is not a good interpreter
of popular songs. She cannot be compared
in this respect with Bert Williams, Blanche
Ring, Stella Mayhew, Al Jolson, May Irwin, Ethel
Levey, Nora Bayes, Fannie Brice, or Marie Cahill.
I have named nearly all the good ones. The
spirit, the very conscious liberties taken with the
text (the vaudeville singer must elaborate his own
syncopations as the singer of early opera embroidered
on the score of the composer) are not
matters that just happen. They require any
amount of work and experience with audiences.
None of the singers I have named is a novice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Nor will you find novices who are able to sing
Schumann and Franz <i>lieder</i>, although they may
be blessed with well-nigh perfect vocal organs.</p>

<p>Still the music critics with strange persistence
continue to adjudge a singer by the old formul&aelig;
and standards: has she an equalized scale? Has
she taste in ornament? Does she overdo the use
of <i>portamento</i>, <i>messa di voce</i>, and such devices?
How is her shake? etc., etc. But how false, how
ridiculous, this is! Fancy the result if new writers
and composers were criticized by the old laws
(so they are, my son, but not for long)! Creative
artists always smash the old tablets of commandments
and it does not seem to me that interpretative
artists need be more unprogressive.
Acting changes. Judged by the standards by
which Edwin Booth was assessed John Drew is
not an actor. But we know now that it is a different
kind of acting. Acting has been flamboyant,
extravagant, and intensely emotional,
something quite different from real life. The
present craze for counterfeiting the semblance of
ordinary existence on the stage will also die out
for the stage is not life and representing life on
the stage (except in a conventionalized or decorative
form) is not art. Our new actors (with our
new playwrights) will develop a new and fantastic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
mode of expression which will supersede the
present fashion.... Rubinstein certainly did
not play the piano like Chopin. Presently a
<i>virtuoso</i> will appear who will refuse to play the
piano at all and a new instrument without a tempered
scale will be invented so that he may indulge
in all the subtleties between half-tones which are
denied to the pianist.</p>

<p>It's all very well to cry, "Halt!" and "Who
goes there?" but you can't stop progress any
more than you can stop the passing of time.
The old technique of the singer breaks down before
the new technique of the composer and the
musician with daring will go still further if the
singer will but follow. Would that some singer
would have the complete courage to lead! But
do not misunderstand me. The road to Parnassus
is no shorter because it has been newly
paved. Indeed I think it is longer. Caffarelli
studied six years before he made his d&eacute;but as "the
greatest singer in the world" but I imagine that
Waslav Nijinsky studied ten before he set foot
on the stage. The new music drama, combining
as it does principles from all the arts is all-demanding
of its interpreters. The new singer
must learn how to move gracefully and awkwardly,
how to make both fantastic and realistic gestures,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
always unconventional gestures, because conventions
stamp the imitator. She must peer into
every period, glance at every nation. Every
nerve centre must be prepared to express any
adumbration of plasticity. Many of the new
operas, <i>Carmen</i>, <i>La Dolores</i>, <i>Salome</i>, <i>Elektra</i>, to
name a few, call for interpretative dancing of the
first order. <i>Madama Butterfly</i> and <i>Lakm&eacute;</i> demand
a knowledge of national characteristics.
<i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> and <i>Ariane et Barbe-Bleue</i> require
of the interpreter absolutely distinct enunciation.
In Handel's operas the phrases were repeated
so many times that the singer was excused
if he proclaimed the meaning of the line once.
After that he could alter the vowels and consonants
to suit his vocal convenience. <i>Monna
Vanna</i> and <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> exact of their interpreters
acting of the highest poetic and imaginative
scope....</p>

<p>It is a question whether certain singers of our
day have not solved these problems with greater
success than that for which they are given
credit.... Yvette Guilbert has announced publicly
that she never had a teacher, that she would
not trust her voice to a teacher. The enchanting
Yvette practises a sound by herself until she is
able to make it; she repeats a phrase until she can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
deliver it without an interrupting breath, and is
there a singer on the stage more expressive than
Yvette Guilbert? She sings a little tenor, a little
baritone, and a little bass. She can succeed almost
invariably in making the effect she sets out
to make. And Yvette Guilbert is the answer to
the statement often made that unorthodox methods
of singing ruin the voice. Ruin it for performances
of <i>Linda di Chaminoux</i> and <i>La Sonnambula</i>
very possibly, but if young singers sit about saving
their voices for performances of these operas they
are more than likely to die unheard. It is a fact
that good singing in the old-fashioned sense will
help nobody out in <i>Elektra</i>, <i>Ariane et Barbe-Bleue</i>,
<i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i>, or <i>The Nightingale</i>.
These works are written in new styles and they
demand a new technique. Put Mme. Melba, Mme.
Destinn, Mme. Sembrich, or Mme. Galli-Curci to
work on these scores and you will simply have a
sad mess.</p>

<p>We have, I think, but a faint glimmering of
what vocal expressiveness may become. Such
torch-bearers as Mariette Mazarin and Feodor
Chaliapine have been procaciously excoriated by
the critics. Until recently Mary Garden, who of
all artists on the lyric stage, is the most nearly in
touch with the singing of the future, has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
treated as a charlatan and a fraud. W. J. Henderson
once called her the "Queen of Unsong."
Well, perhaps she is, but she is certainly better
able to cope artistically with the problems of the
modern music drama than such Queens of Song as
Marcella Sembrich and Adelina Patti would be.
Perhaps Unsong is the name of the new art.</p>

<p>I do not think I have ever been backward in expressing
my appreciation of this artist. My essay
devoted to her in "Interpreters and Interpretations"
will certainly testify eloquently as to my
previous attitude in regard to her. But it has
not always been so with some of my colleagues.
Since she has been away from us they have learned
something; they have watched and listened to
others and so when Mary Garden came back to
New York in <i>Monna Vanna</i> in January, 1918, they
were ready to sing choruses of praise in her honour.
They have been encomiastic even in regard to her
voice and her manner of singing.</p>

<p>Even my own opinion of this artist's work has
undergone a change. I have always regarded her
as one of the few great interpreters, but in the
light of recent experience I now feel assured that
she is the greatest artist on the contemporary lyric
stage. It is not, I would insist, Mary Garden that
has changed so much as we ourselves. She has, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
is true, polished her interpretations until they
seem incredibly perfect, but has there ever been a
time when she gave anything but perfect impersonations
of M&eacute;lisande or Thais? Has she ever
been careless before the public? I doubt it.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that when Mary Garden
first came to New York only a few of us were
ready to receive her at anywhere near her true
worth. In a field where mediocrity and brainlessness,
lack of theatrical instinct and vocal insipidity
are fairly the rule her dominant personality,
her unerring search for novelty of expression,
the very completeness of her dramatic and
vocal pictures, annoyed the philistines, the professors,
and the academicians. They had been accustomed
to taking their opera quietly with their after-dinner
coffee and, on the whole, they preferred it
that way.</p>

<p>But the main obstacle in the way of her complete
success lay in the matter of her voice, of her singing.
Of the quality of any voice there can always
exist a thousand different opinions. To me the
great beauty of the middle register of Mary Garden's
voice has always been apparent. But what
was not so evident at first was the absolute fitness
of this voice and her method of using it for the
dramatic style of the artist and for the artistic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
demands of the works in which she appeared.
Thoroughly musical, Miss Garden has often puzzled
her critical hearers by singing <i>Faust</i> in one
vocal style and <i>Thais</i> in another. But she was
right and they were wrong. She might, indeed,
have experimented still further with a new vocal
technique if she had been given any encouragement
but encouragement is seldom offered to any innovator.
As Edgar Saltus puts it, "The number
of people who regard a new idea or a fresh theory
as a personal insult is curiously large; indeed they
are more frequent today than when Socrates
quaffed the hemlock." It must, therefore, be a
source of ironic amusement to her to find herself
now appreciated not alone by her public, which
has always been loyal and adoring, but also by
the professors themselves.</p>

<p>It would do no harm to any singer to study the
multitude of vocal effects this artist achieves. I
can think of nobody who could not learn something
from her. How, for example, she gives her voice
the hue and colour of a <i>jeune fille</i> in <i>Pell&eacute;as et
M&eacute;lisande</i>, for although M&eacute;lisande had been the
bride of Barbe-Bleue before Golaud discovered her
in the forest she had never learned to be anything
else than innocent and distraught, unhappy and
mysterious. Her treatment of certain important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
phrases in this work is so electrifying in its effect
that the heart of every auditor is pierced. Remember,
for example, her question to Pell&eacute;as at
the end of the first act, "<i>Pourquoi partez-vous?</i>"
to which she imparts a kind of dreamy intuitive
longing; recall the amazement shining through her
grief at Golaud's command that she ask Pell&eacute;as to
accompany her on her search for the lost ring:
"<i>Pell&eacute;as!&mdash;Avec Pell&eacute;as!&mdash;Mais Pell&eacute;as ne
voudra pas</i>...."; and do not forget the terrified
cry which signals the discovery of the hidden
Golaud in the park, "<i>Il y a quelqu'un derri&egrave;re
nous!</i>"</p>

<p>In <i>Monna Vanna</i> her most magnificent vocal gesture
rested on the single word <i>Si</i> in reply to
Guido's "<i>Tu ne reviendras pas?</i>" Her performance
of this work, however, offers many examples
of just such instinctive intonations. One
more, I must mention, her answer to Guido's insistent,
"<i>Cet homme t'a-t-il prise?</i>" ... "<i>J'ai
dit la v&eacute;rit&eacute;.... Il ne m'a pas touch&eacute;e</i>," sung
with dignity, with force, with womanliness, and yet
with growing impatience and a touch of sadness.</p>

<p>Let me quote Pitts Sanborn: "It is easy to
be flippant about Miss Garden's singing. Her
faults of voice and technique are patent to a child,
though he might not name them. One who has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
become a man can ponder the greatness of her
singing. I do not mean exclusively in Debussy,
though we all know that as a singer of Debussy
... she has scarce a rival. Take her <i>mezza
voce</i> and her phrasing in the second act of
<i>Monna Vanna</i>, take them and bow down before
them. Ponder a moment her singing in <i>Thais</i>.
The converted Thais, about to betake herself
desertward with the insistent monk, has a solo to
sing. The solo is Massenet, simon-pure Massenet,
the idol of the Paris <i>midinette</i>. Miss Garden, with
a defective voice, a defective technique, exalts and
magnifies that passage till it might be the noblest
air of Handel or of Mozart. By a sheer and unashamed
reliance on her command of style, Miss
Garden works that miracle, transfigures Massenet
into something superearthly, overpowering.
Will you rise up to deny that is singing?"</p>

<p>As for her acting, there can scarcely be two
opinions about that! She is one of the few possessors
of that rare gift of imparting atmosphere
and mood to a characterization. Some
exceptional actors and singers accomplish this feat
occasionally. Mary Garden has scarcely ever
failed to do so. The moment M&eacute;lisande is disclosed
to our view, for example, she seems to be
surrounded by an aura entirely distinct from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
aura which surrounds Monna Vanna, Jean, Thais,
Salome, or Sapho. She becomes, indeed, so much
a part of the character she assumes that the
spectator finds great difficulty in dissociating her
from that character, and I have found those who,
having seen Mary Garden in only one part, were
quite ready to generalize about her own personality
from the impression they had received.</p>

<p>One of the tests of great acting is whether or
not an artist remains in the picture when she is
not singing or speaking. Mary Garden knows how
to listen on the stage. She does not need to move
or speak to make herself a part of the action and
she is never guilty of such an offence against artistry
as that committed by Tamagno, who, according
to Victor Maurel, allowed a scene in <i>Otello</i>
to drop to nothing while he prepared himself to
emit a high B.</p>

<p>Watching her magnificent performance of
Monna Vanna it struck me that she would make an
incomparable Isolde. At the present moment I
cannot imagine Mary Garden learning Boche or
singing in it even if she knew it, but if some one
will present us Wagner's (who hated the Germans
as much as Theodore Roosevelt does) music drama
in French or English with Mary Garden as Isolde,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
I think the public will thank me for having suggested
it.</p>

<p>Or it would be even better if Schoenberg, or
Stravinsky, or Leo Ornstein, inspired by the new
light the example of such a singer has cast over
our lyric stage, would write a music drama, ignoring
the technique and the conventions of the past,
as Debussy did when he wrote <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i>
(creating opportunities which any opera-goer
of the last decade knows how gloriously Miss
Garden realized). It is thus that the new order
will gradually become established. And then the
new art ... the new art of the singer....</p>

<h2><a name="Au_Bal_Musette" id="Au_Bal_Musette"></a>Au Bal Musette</h2>


<p>It has often been remarked by philosophers
and philistines alike that the commonest facts
of existence escape our attention until they
are impressed upon it in some unusual way. For
example I knew nothing of the sovereign powers
of citronella as a mosquito dispatcher until a
plague of the insects drove me to make enquiries of
a chemist. For years I believed that knocking the
necks off bottles, lacking an opener, was the only
alternative. A friend who caught me in this predicament
showed me the other use to which the
handles of high-boy drawers could be put. It was
long my habit to quickly dispose of trousers which
had been disfigured by cigarette burns, but that
was before I had heard of <i>stoppage</i>, a process by
which the original weave is cleverly counterfeited.
And, wishing to dance, in Paris, I have been guilty
of visits to the great dance halls and to the small
smart places where champagne is oppressively the
only listed beverage. But that was before I discovered
the <i>bal musette</i>.</p>

<p>One July night in Paris I had dinner with a certain
lady at the Cou-Cou, followed by cognac at
the Savoyarde. I find nothing strange in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
program; it seems to me that I must have dined
at the Cou-Cou with every one I have known in
Paris from time to time, a range of acquaintanceship
including Fernand, the <i>apache</i>, and the
Comtesse de J&mdash;&mdash;, and cognac at the Savoyarde
usually followed the dinner. This evening at the
Cou-Cou then resembled any other evening. Do
you know how to go there? You must take a taxi-cab
to the foot of the hill of Montmartre and then
be drawn up in the <i>finiculaire</i> to the top where
the church of Sacr&eacute;-Coeur squats proudly, for all
the world like a mammoth Buddha (of course
you may ride all the way up the mountain in your
taxi if you like). From Sacr&eacute;-Coeur one turns to
the left around the board fence which, it would
seem, will always hedge in this unfinished monument
of pious Catholics; still turning to the left,
through the Place du Tertre, in which one must
not be stayed by the pleasant sight of the <i>Montmartroises
bourgeoises</i> eating <i>petite marmite</i> in
the open air, one arrives at the Place du Calvaire.
The tables of the Restaurant Cou-Cou occupy
nearly the whole of this tiny square, to which there
are only two means of approach, one up the stairs
from the city below, and the other from the Place
du Tertre. An artist's house disturbs the view on
the side towards Paris; opposite is the restaurant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
flanked on the right by a row of modest apartment
houses, to which one gains entrance through a
high wall by means of a small gate. Sundry visitors
to these houses, some on bicycles, make occasional
interruptions in the dinner.... From over
this wall, too, comes the huge Cheshire cat (much
bigger than Alice's, a beautiful animal), which
lounges about in the hope, frequently realized, that
some one will give him a chicken bone.... Conterminous
to the restaurant, on the right, is a tiny
cottage, fronted by a still tinier garden, fenced in
and gated. Many of the visitors to the Cou-Cou
hang their hats and sticks on this fence and its
gate. I have never seen the occupants of the
cottage in any of my numerous visits to this open
air restaurant, but once, towards eleven o'clock
the crowd in the square becoming too noisy, the
upper windows were suddenly thrown up and a
pailful of water descended.... "<i>Per Baccho!</i>"
quoth the inn-keeper for, it must be known, the
Restaurant Cou-Cou is Italian by nature of its
<i>patron</i> and its cooking.</p>

<p>This night, I say, had been as the others. The
Cou-Cou is (and in this respect it is not exceptional
in Paris) safe to return to if you have found it to
your liking in years gone by. Perhaps some day
the small boy of the place will be grown up. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
is a real <i>enfant terrible</i>. It is his pleasure to
<i>tutoyer</i> the guests, to amuse himself by pretending
to serve them, only to bring the wrong dishes, or
none at all. If you call to him he is deaf. Any
hope of <i>revanche</i> is abandoned in the reflection of
the super-retaliations he himself conceives. One
young man who expresses himself freely on the subject
of Pietro receives a plate of hot soup down
the back of his neck, followed immediately by a
"<i>Pardon, Monsieur</i>," said not without respect.
But where might Pietro's father be? He is in the
kitchen cooking and if you find your dinner coming
too slowly at the hands of the distracted maid
servants, who also have to put up with Pietro, go
into the kitchen, passing under the little vine-clad
porch wherein you may discover a pair of lovers,
and help yourself. And if you find some one else's
dinner more to your liking than your own take that
off the stove instead. At the Cou-Cou you pay
for what you eat, not for what you order. And
the Signora, Pietro's mother? That unhappy
woman usually stands in front of the door, where
she interferes with the passage of the girls going
for food. She wrings her hands and moans,
"<i>Mon Dieu, quel monde!</i>" with the idea that she
is helping vastly in the manipulation of the
machinery of the place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>And the <i>monde</i>; who goes there? It is not too
<i>chic</i>, this <i>monde</i>, and yet it is surely not <i>bourgeois</i>;
if one does not recognize M. Rodin or M.
Georges Feydeau, yet there are compensations....
The girls who come attended by bearded companions,
are unusually pretty; one sees them afterwards
at the bars and <i>bals</i> if one does not go to
the Abbaye or Pag&eacute;s.... It makes a very pleasant
picture, the Place du Calvaire towards nine
o'clock on a summer night when tiny lights with
pink globes are placed on the tables. The little
square twinkles with them and the couples at the
tables become very gay, and sometimes sentimental.
And when the pink lights appear a small
boy in blue trousers comes along to light the street
lamp. Then the urchins gather on the wall which
hedges in the garden on the fourth side of the
square and chatter, chatter, chatter, about all
the things that French boys chatter about.
Naturally they have a good deal to say about the
people who are eating.</p>

<p>I have described the Cou-Cou as it was this
night and as it has been all the nights during the
past eight summers that I have been there.
The dinner too is always the same. It is served <i>&agrave;
la carte</i>, but one is not given much choice. There
is always a <i>potage</i>, always <i>spaghetti</i>, always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
chicken and a salad, always a lobster, and <i>zabaglione</i>
if one wants it. The wine&mdash;it is called
<i>chianti</i>&mdash;is tolerable. And the <i>addition</i> is made
upon a slate with a piece of white chalk. "<i>Qu'est-ce
que monsieur a mang&eacute;?</i>" Sometimes it is very
difficult to remember, but it is necessary. Such
honesty compels an exertion. It is all added up
and for the two of us on this evening, or any other
evening, it may come to nine <i>francs</i>, which is not
much to pay for a good dinner.</p>

<p>Then, on this evening, and every other evening,
we went on, back as we had come, round past the
other side of Sacr&eacute;-Coeur, past the statue of the
Chevalier who was martyred for refusing to salute
a procession (why he refused I have never found
out, although I have asked everybody who has ever
dined with me at the Cou-Cou) to the Caf&eacute; Savoyarde,
the broad windows of which look out over
pretty much all the Northeast of Paris, over a
glittering labyrinth of lights set in an obscure
sea of darkness. It was not far from here that
Louise and Julien kept house when they were interrupted
by Louise's mother, and it was looking
down over these lights that they swore those eternal
vows, ending with Louise's "<i>C'est une F&eacute;erie!</i>"
and Julien's "<i>Non, c'est la vie!</i>" One always
remembers these things and feels them at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Savoyarde as keenly as one did sometime in the
remote past watching Mary Garden and L&eacute;on
Beyle from the topmost gallery of the Op&eacute;ra-Comique
after an hour and a half wait in the
<i>queue</i> for one <i>franc</i> tickets (there were always
people turned away from performances of <i>Louise</i>
and so it was necessary to be there early; some
other operas did not demand such punctuality).
There is a terrace outside the Savoyarde, a tiny
terrace, with just room for one man, who griddles
<i>gaufrettes</i>, and three or four tiny tables with
chairs. At one of these we sat that night (just
as I had sat so many times before) and sipped our
cognac.</p>

<p>It is difficult in an adventure to remember just
when the departure comes, when one leaves the
past and strides into the future, but I think that
moment befell me in this caf&eacute; ... for it was the
first time I had ever seen a cat there. He was a
lazy, splendid animal. In New York he would have
been an oddity, but in Paris there are many such
beasts. Tawny he was and soft to the touch and
of a hugeness. He was lying on the bar and as I
stroked his coat he purred melifluously.... I
stroked his warm fur and thought how I belonged
to the mystic band (Gautier, Baudelaire, M&eacute;rim&eacute;e,
all knew the secrets) of those who are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>acquainted
with cats; it is a feeling of pride we have
that differentiates us from the dog lovers, the
pride of the appreciation of indifference or of
conscious preference. And it was, I think, as I
was stroking the cat that my past was smote
away from me and I was projected into the adventure
for, as I lifted the animal into my arms,
the better to feel its warmth and softness, it
sprang with strength and unsheathed claws out
of my embrace, and soon was back on the bar
again, "just as if nothing had happened." There
was blood on my face. Madame, behind the bar,
was apologetic but not chastening. "<i>Il avait
peur</i>," she said. "<i>Il n'est pas m&eacute;chant.</i>" The
wound was not deep, and as I bent to pet the cat
again he again purred. I had interfered with his
habits and, as I discovered later, he had interfered
with mine.</p>

<p>We decided to walk down the hill instead of
riding down in the <i>finiculaire</i>, down the stairs
which form another of the pictures in <i>Louise</i>, with
the abutting houses, into the rooms of which one
looks, conscious of prying. And you see the old
in these interiors, making shoes, or preparing dinner,
or the middle-aged going to bed, but the young
one never sees in the houses in the summer....
It was early and we decided to dance; I thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the Moulin de la Galette, which I had visited twice
before. The Moulin de la Galette waves its gaunt
arms in the air half way up the <i>butte</i> of Montmartre;
it serves its purpose as a dance hall of the
quarter. One meets the pretty little <i>Montmartroises</i>
there and the young artists; the entrance
fee is not exorbitant and one may drink a bock.
And when I have been there, sitting at a small
table facing the somewhat vivid mural decoration
which runs the length of one wall, drinking my
brown <i>bock</i>, I have remembered the story which
Mary Garden once told me, how Albert Carr&eacute; to
celebrate the hundredth&mdash;or was it the twenty-fifth?&mdash;performance
of <i>Louise</i>, gave a dinner
there&mdash;so near to the scenes he had conceived&mdash;to
Charpentier and how, surrounded by some of
the most notable musicians and poets of France,
the composer had suddenly fallen from the table,
face downwards; he had starved himself so long to
complete his masterpiece that food did not seem
to nourish him. It was the end of a brilliant dinner.
He was carried away ... to the Riviera;
some said that he had lost his mind; some said
that he was dying. Mary Garden herself did not
know, at the time she first sang <i>Louise</i> in America,
what had happened to him. But a little later the
rumour that he was writing a trilogy was spread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
about and soon it was a known fact that at least
one other part of the trilogy had been written,
<i>Julien</i>; that lyric drama was produced and everybody
knows the story of its failure. Charpentier,
the natural philosopher and the poet of Montmartre,
had said everything he had to say in
<i>Louise</i>. As for the third play, one has heard
nothing about that yet.</p>

<p>But on this evening the Moulin de la Galette was
closed and then I remembered that it was open on
Thursday and this was Wednesday. Is it
Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday that the Moulin
de la Galette is open? I think so. By this time
we were determined to dance; but where? We had
no desire to go to some stupid place, common to
tourists, no such place as the Bal Tabarin lured
us; nor did the Grelot in the Place Blanche, for
we had been there a night or two before. The
Elys&eacute;e Montmartre (celebrated by George Moore)
would be closed. Its <i>patron</i> followed the schedule
of days adopted for the Galette.... To chance
I turn in such dilemmas.... I consulted a small
boy, who, with his companion, had been good
enough to guide us through many winding streets
to the Moulin. Certainly he knew of a <i>bal</i>.
Would <i>monsieur</i> care to visit a <i>bal musette</i>? His
companion was horrified. I caught the phrase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
"<i>mal frequent&eacute;</i>." Our curiosity was aroused and
we gave the signal to advance.</p>

<p>There were two grounds for my personal curiosity
beyond the more obvious ones. I seemed
to remember to have read somewhere that the
ladies of the court of Louis XIV played the
<i>musette</i>, which is French for bag-pipe. It was the
fashionable instrument of an epoch and the <i>musettes</i>
played by the <i>grandes dames</i> were elaborately
decorated. The word in time slunk into
the dictionaries of musical terms as descriptive of
a drone bass. Many of Gluck's ballet airs bear
the title, <i>Musette</i>. Perhaps the bass was even performed
on a bag-pipe.... "<i>Mal frequent&eacute;</i>" in
Parisian <i>argot</i> has a variety of significations; in
this particular instance it suggested <i>apaches</i> to
me. A <i>bal</i>, for instance, attended by <i>cocottes</i>,
<i>mannequins</i>, or <i>mod&egrave;les</i>, could not be described as
<i>mal frequent&eacute;</i> unless one were speaking to a boarding
school miss, for all the public <i>bals</i> in Paris are
so attended. No, the words spoken to me, in this
connection, could only mean <i>apaches</i>. The confusion
of epochs began to invite my interest and I
wondered, in my mind's eye, how a Louis XIV
<i>apache</i> would dress, how he would be represented
at a costume ball, and a picture of a ragged silk-betrousered
person, flaunting a plaid-bellied <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>instrument
came to mind. An imagination often
leads one violently astray.</p>

<p>The two urchins were marching us through
street after street, one of them whistling that
pleasing tune, <i>Le lendemain elle &eacute;tait souriante</i>.
Dark passage ways intervened between us and our
destination: we threaded them. The cobble stones
of the underfoot were not easy to walk on for my
companion, shod in high-heels from the Place
Vend&ocirc;me.... The urchins amused each other
and us by capers on the way. They could have
made our speed walking on their hands, and they
accomplished at least a third of the journey this
way. Of course, I deluged them with large round
five and ten <i>centimes</i> pieces.</p>

<p>We arrived at last before a door in a short
street near the Gare du Nord. Was it the Rue
Jessaint? I do not know, for when, a year later,
I attempted to re-find this <i>bal</i> it had disappeared....
We could hear the hum of the pipes for some
paces before we turned the corner into the street,
and never have pipes sounded in my ears with
such a shrill significance of being somewhere they
ought not to be, never but once, and that was
when I had heard the piper who accompanies the
dinner of the Governor of the Bahamas in Nassau.
Marching round the porch of the Governor's Villa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
he played <i>The Blue Bells of Scotland</i> and <i>God
Save the King</i>, but, hearing the sound from a distance
through the interstices of the cocoa-palm
fronds in the hot tropical night, I could only think
of a Hindoo blowing the pipes in India, the charming
of snakes.... So, as we turned the corner
into the Rue Jessaint, I seemed to catch a faint
glimpse of a scene on the lawn at Versailles....
Louis XIV&mdash;it was the epoch of Cinderella!</p>

<p>But it wasn't a bag-pipe at all. That we discovered
when we entered the room, after passing
through the bar in the front. The <i>bal</i> was conducted
in a large hall at the back of the <i>maison</i>.
In the doorway lounged an <i>agent de service</i>, always
a guest at one of these functions, I found out
later. There were rows of tables, long tables, with
long wooden benches placed between them. One
corner of the floor was cleared&mdash;not so large a
corner either&mdash;for dancing, and on a small platform
sat the strangest looking youth, like Peter
Pan never to grow old, like the <i>Monna Lisa</i> a boy
of a thousand years, without emotion or expression
of any sort. He was playing an accordion;
the bag-pipe, symbol of the <i>bal</i>, hung disused on
the wall over his head. His accordion, manipulated
with great skill, was augmented by sleigh-bells
attached to his ankles in such a manner that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
a minimum of movement produced a maximum of
effect; he further added to the complexity of sound
and rhythm by striking a cymbal occasionally
with one of his feet. The music was both rhythmic
and ordered, now a waltz, now a tune in two-four
time, but never faster or slower, and never
ending ... except in the middle of each dance,
for a brief few seconds, while the <i>patronne</i> collected
a <i>sou</i> from each dancer, after which the
dance proceeded. All the time we remained never
did the musician smile, except twice, once briefly
when I sent word to him by the waiter to order a
<i>consommation</i> and once, at some length, when we
departed. On these occasions the effect was almost
emotionally illuminating, so inexpressive was
the ordinary cast of his features. A strange lad;
I like to think of him always sitting there, passively,
playing the accordion and shaking his
sleigh-bells. He suggested a static picture, a
thing of always, but I know it is not so, for even
the next summer he had disappeared along with
the <i>bal</i> and now he may have been shot in the
Battle of the Marne or he may have murdered his
<i>gigolette</i> and been transported to one of the
French penal colonies.... An <i>apache, en musicien!</i> ...
black cloth around his throat, hair
parted in the middle, <i>velours</i> trousers; a <i>vrai<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
apache</i> I tell you, a cool, cunning creature,
shredded with cocaine and absinthe, monotonous in
his virtuosity, playing the accordion. He had
begun before we arrived and he continued after we
left. I like to think of him as always playing,
but it is not so....</p>

<p>As for the dancers, they were of various kinds
and sorts. The women had that air which gave
them the stamp of a quarter; they wore loose
<i>blouses</i>, tucked in plaid skirts, or dark blue skirts,
or multi-coloured calico skirts (if you have seen
the lithographs of Steinlen you may reconstruct
the picture with no difficulty) and they danced in
that peculiar fashion so much in vogue in the
Northern outskirts of Paris. The men seized
them tightly and they whirled to the inexorable
music when it was a waltz, whirled and whirled,
until one thought of the Viennese and how they
become as dervishes and Japanese mice when one
plays Johann Strauss. But in the dances in two-four
time their way was more our way, something
between a one-step, a mattchiche, and a tango,
with strange fascinating steps of their own devising,
a folk-dance manner.... Yes, under their
feet, the dance became a real dance of the people
and, when we entered into it, our feet seemed heavy
and our steps conventional, although we tried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
do what they did. (How they did laugh at us!)
And the strange youth emphasized the effect of
folk-dancing by playing old <i>chansons de France</i>
which he mingled with his repertory of <i>caf&eacute;-concert</i>
airs. And there was achieved that wonderful
thing (to an artist) a mixture of <i>genres</i>&mdash;intriguing
one's curiosity, awakening the most dormant
interest, and inspiring the dullest imagination.</p>

<p>This was my first night at a <i>bal musette</i> and
my last in that year, for shortly afterwards I left
for Italy and in Italy one does not dance. But
the next season found me anxious to renew the adventure,
to again enjoy the pleasures of the <i>bal
musette</i>. I have said I was perhaps wrong in recalling
the street as the Rue Jessaint, or perhaps
the old <i>maison</i> had disappeared. At any rate,
when I searched I could not find the <i>bal</i>, not even
the bar. So again I appealed for help, this time
to a chauffeur, who drove me to the opposite side
of the city, to the <i>quartier</i> of the <i>Halles</i>....
And I was beginning to think that the man had misunderstood
me, or was stupid. "He will take me
to a cabaret, l'Ange Gabriel or"&mdash;and I rapidly
revolved in my mind the possibilities of this quarter
where the <i>apaches</i> come to the surface to feel
the purse of the tourist, who buys drinks as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
listens to stories of murders, some of which have
been committed, for it is true that some of the
real <i>apaches</i> go there (I know because my friend
Fernand did and it was in l'Ange Gabriel that he
knocked all the teeth down the throat of Ang&eacute;lique,
<i>sa gigolette</i>. You may find the life of these
creatures vividly and amusingly described in that
amazing book of Charles-Henry Hirsch, "Le Tigre
et Coquelicot" It is the only book I have read
about the <i>apaches</i> of modern Paris that is worth
its pages). But the idea of l'Ange Gabriel was
not amusing to me this evening and I leaned forward
to ask my chauffeur if he had it in mind to
substitute another attraction for my desired <i>bal
musette</i>. His reply was reassuring; it took the
form of a gesture, the waving of a hand towards a
small lighted globe depending over the door of a
little <i>marchand de vin</i>. On this globe was painted
in black letters the single word, <i>bal</i>. We were in
the narrow Rue des Gravilliers&mdash;I was there for
the first time&mdash;and the <i>bal</i> was the Bal des Gravilliers.</p>

<p>The bar is so small, when one enters, that there
is no intimation of the really splendid aspect of
the dancing room. For here there are two rooms
separated by the dancing floor, two halls filled
with tables, with long wooden benches between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
them. Benches also line the walls, which are white
with a grey-blue frieze; the lighting is brilliant.
The musicians play in a little balcony, and here
there are two of them, an accordionist and a
guitarist. The performer on the accordion is a
<i>virtuoso</i>; he takes delight in winding florid ornament,
after the manner of some brilliant singer
impersonating Rosina in <i>Il Barbiere</i>, around
the melodies he performs. As in the Rue Jessaint
a <i>sou</i> is demanded in the middle of each dance.
But there comparison must cease, for the life here
is gayer, more of a character. The types are of
the <i>Halles</i>.... There are strange exits....</p>

<p>A short woman enters; "<i>elle s'avance en se
balan&ccedil;ant sur ses hanches comme une pouliche du
haras de Cordoue</i>"; she suggests an operatic Carmen
in her swagger. She is slender, with short,
dark hair, cropped <i>&agrave; la</i> Boutet de Monvel, and she
flourishes a cigarette, the smoke from which
wreathes upward and obscures&mdash;nay makes more
subtle&mdash;the strange poignancy of her deep blue
eyes. Her nose is of a snubness. It is the <i>m&ocirc;me</i>
Estelle, and as she passes down the narrow aisle,
between the tables, there is a stir of excitement....
The men raise their eyes.... Edouard, <i>le
petit</i>, flicks a <i>louis</i> carelessly between his thumb
and fore-finger, with the long dirty nails, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
passes it back into his pocket. Do not mistake
the gesture; it is not made to entice the <i>m&ocirc;me</i>, nor
is it a sign of affluence; it is Edouard's means of
demanding another <i>louis</i> before the night is up, if
it be only a "<i>louis de dix francs</i>." Estelle looks
at him boldly; there is no fear in her eyes; you can
see that she would face death with Carmen's calm
if the Fates cut the thread to that effect....
The music begins and Estelle dances with Carmella,
<i>l'Arabe</i>. Edouard glowers and pulls his
little grey cap down tower.... It is a waltz....
Suddenly he is on the floor and Estelle is
pressed close to his body.... Carmella sits
down. She smiles, and presently she is dancing
with Jean-Baptiste.... Estelle and Edouard are
now whirling, whirling, and all the while his dark
eyes look down piercingly into her blue eyes. The
music stops. Estelle fumbles in her stocking for
two <i>sous</i>. Edouard lights a <i>Maryland</i>.</p>

<p>There is a newcomer tonight. (I am talking
to the <i>agent de service</i>.) She is of a youth and
she is certainly from Brittany. I see her sitting
in a corner, waiting for something, trying to know.
"She will learn," says my friend, "She will learn
to pay like the others." That is the <i>gros</i> Pierre
who regards her. He twirls his moustache and
considers, and in the end he lumbers to her and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
asks her to dance. She is willing to do so, but the
intensity of Pierre frightens her, frightens and intrigues....
There is a sign on the wall that one
must not stamp one's feet, but no other prohibition....
He twists her finger purposely as they
whirl ... and whirl. She cowers. <i>Gros</i> Pierre
is very big and strong. "<i>T'es bath, m&ocirc;me</i>," I
hear him say, as they pass me by.... The dance
over, he towers above her for a brief second before
he swaggers out.... Estelle smiles. Her lips
move and she speaks quickly to Edouard, <i>le petit</i>....
He does not listen. Why should he listen to
his <i>gigolette</i>? She is wasting her time here anyway.
He becomes impatient.... Carmella
smiles across the room in a brief second of chance
and Estelle answers the smile. Carmella holds up
three fingers (it is now 1.30). Estelle nods her
head quickly. The musicians are always playing,
except in the middle of the dance when <i>madame, la
patronne</i>, gathers in the <i>sous</i>.... Only from
one she takes nothing.... He is twenty and very
blonde and he is dancing with <i>Madame</i>.... Between
dances she pays his <i>consommations</i>....
Estelle rises slowly and walks out while Carmella,
<i>l'Arabe</i>, follows her with his eyes. Edouard, <i>le
petit</i>, lights a <i>Maryland</i> and poises a <i>louis</i> between
his thumb and fore-finger, the nails of which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
long and dirty.... The music is always playing....
The little girl from Brittany is again alone
in the corner. There is fear in her face. She is
beginning to know. She summons her courage and
walks to the door, on through.... The <i>agent de
service</i> twirls his moustache and points after her.
"She soon will know." I follow. She hesitates
for a second at the street door and then starts
towards the corner.... She reaches the corner
and passes around it.... I hear a scream ...
the sound of running footsteps ... the beat of
a horse's hoofs ... the rolling of wheels on the
cobble stones....</p>

<h2><a name="Music_and_Cooking" id="Music_and_Cooking"></a>Music and Cooking</h2>


<p>It is my firm belief that there is an intimate
relationship between the stomach and the ear,
the saucepan and the crotchet, the mysteries
of Mrs. Rorer and the mysteries of Mme. Marchesi.
It has even occurred to me that one of the
reasons our American composers are so barren in
ideas is because as a race we are not interested in
cooking and eating. Those countries in which
music plays the greater part in the national life
are precisely those which are the most interested in
the culinary art. The food of Italy, the cooking,
is celebrated; every peasant in that sunny land
sings, and the voices of some Italians have reverberated
around the world. The very melodies of
Verdi and Rossini are inextricably twined in our
minds around memories of <i>ravioli</i> and <i>zabaglione</i>.
<i>Vesti la Giubba</i> is <i>spaghetti</i>. The composers of
these melodies and their interpreters alike cooked,
ate, and drank with joy, and so they composed and
sang with joy too. Men with indigestion may be
able to write novels, but they cannot compose great
music.... The Germans spend more time eating
than the people of any other country (at least they
did once). It is small occasion for wonder, therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
that they produce so many musicians. They
are always eating, mammoth plates heaped high
with Bavarian cabbage, <i>Koenigsberger Klopps</i>,
<i>Hasenpfeffer</i>, noodles, sauerkraut, <i>Wiener Schnitzel</i> ... drinking
seidels of beer. They escort
sausages with them to the opera. All the women
have their skirts honeycombed with capacious
pockets, in which they carry substantial lunches to
eat while Isolde is deceiving King Mark. Why,
the very principle of German music is based on a
theory of well-fed auditors. The voluptuous
scores of Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss, Max
Schillings and Co. were not written for skinny, ill-nourished
wights. Even Beethoven demands flesh
and bone of his hearers. The music of Bach is
directly aimed against the doctrine of asceticism.
"The German capacity for feeling emotion in
music has developed to the same extent as the
capacity of the German stomach for containing
food," writes Ernest Newman, "but in neither the
one case nor the other has there been a corresponding
development in refinement of perceptions.
German sentimental music is not quite as gross as
German food and German feeding, but it comes
very near to it sometimes.... 'The Germans do
not taste,' said Montaigne, 'they gulp.' As with
their food, so with the emotions of their music.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
So long as they get them in sufficient mass, of the
traditional quality, and with the traditional pungent
seasoning, they are content to leave piquancy
and variety of effect to others."... Once in
Munich in a second storey window of the Bayerischebank
I saw a small boy, about ten years old,
sitting outside on the sill, washing the panes of
glass. Opposite him on the same sill a dachshund
reposed on her paws, regarding her master affectionately.
Between the two stood a half-filled
toby of foaming L&ouml;wenbrau, which, from time to
time, the lad raised to his lips, quaffing deep
draughts. And when he set the pot down he whistled
the first subject of Beethoven's <i>Fifth Symphony</i>.
On Sunday afternoons, in the gardens
which invariably surround the Munich breweries,
the happy mothers, who gather to listen to the
band play while they drink beer, frequently replenish
the empty nursing bottles of their offspring at
the taps from which flows the deep brown beverage....
The food of the French is highly artificial,
delicately prepared and served, and flavoured with
infinite art: <i>vol au vent &agrave; la reine</i> and Massenet,
<i>petits pois &agrave; l'etuv&eacute;e</i> and Gounod, <i>oeuf Ste. Clotilde</i>
and C&eacute;sar Franck, all strike the tongue and
the ear quite pleasantly. Des Esseintes and his
liqueur symphony were the inventions of a Frenchman....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Hungarian goulash and Hungarian
rhapsodies are certainly designed to be taken in
conjunction.... Russian music tastes of <i>kascha</i>
and <i>bortsch</i> and vodka. The happy, hearty eaters
of Russia, the drunken, sodden drinkers of Russia
are reflected in the scores of <i>Boris Godunow</i>
and <i>Petrouchka</i>.... In England we find that the
great English meat pasties and puddings appeared
in the same century with the immortal Purcell....
But in America we import our cooks
... and our music. As a race we do not like to
cook. We scarcely like to eat. We certainly do
not enjoy eating. We will never have a national
music until we have national dishes and national
drinks and until we like good food. It is significant
that our national drinks at present are
mixed drinks, the ingredients of which are foreign.
It is doubly significant that that section of the
country which produces chicken <i>&agrave; la Maryland</i>,
corn bread, beaten biscuit, mint juleps, and New
Orleans fizzes has furnished us with the best of
such music as we can boast. Maine has offered us
no <i>Suwanee River</i>; we owe no <i>Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot</i> to Nebraska. The best of our ragtime
composers are Jews, a race which regards eating
and cooking of sufficient importance to include<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
rules for the preparation and disposition of food
in its religious tenets.</p>

<p>Most musicians and those who enjoy listening to
music, like to eat (this does not mean that people
who like to eat always desire to listen to music at
the same time, but nowadays one has little choice
in the matter); what is more pregnant, most of
them like to cook. We may include even the music
critics, one of whom (Henry T. Finck) has written
a book about such matters. The others eat
... and expand. James Huneker devotes sixteen
pages of "The New Cosmopolis" to the "maw of
the monster." And as H. L. Mencken has pointed
out, "The Pilsner motive runs through the book
from cover to cover." Dinners are constantly
being given for the musicians and critics to meet
and talk over thirteen courses with wine. You
may read Mr. Krehbiel's glowing accounts of the
dinner given to Adelina Patti (a dinner referred
to in Joseph Hergesheimer's lyric novel, "The
Three Black Pennys") on the occasion of her
twenty-fifth anniversary as a singer, of the dinner
to Marcella Sembrich to mark her retirement
from the opera stage, and of a dinner to Teresa
Carre&ntilde;o when she proposed a toast to her three
husbands.... Go to the opera house and observe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the lady singers, with their ample bosoms and
their broad hips, the men with their expansive
paunches ... and use your imagination. Why
is it, when a singer is interviewed for a newspaper,
that she invariably finds herself tired of
hotel food and wants an apartment of her own,
where she can cook to her stomach's content?
Why are the musical journals and the Sunday
supplements of the newspapers always publishing
pictures of contralti with their sleeves rolled back
to the elbows, their Poiret gowns (cunningly and
carefully exhibited nevertheless) covered with
aprons, baking bread, turning omelettes, or preparing
clam broth Uncle Sam? You, my reader,
have surely seen these pictures, but it has perhaps
not occurred to you to conjure up a reason for
them.</p>

<p>Edgar Saltus says: "A perfect dinner should
resemble a concert. As the <i>morceaux</i> succeed each
other, so, too, should the names of the composers."
Few dinners in New York may be regarded as concerts
and still fewer restaurants may be looked
upon as concert halls, except, unfortunately, in
the literal sense. However, if you can find a restaurant
where opera singers and conductors eat
you may be sure it is a good one. Huneker describes
the old Lienau's, where William Steinway,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Anton Seidl, Theodore Thomas, Scharwenka,
Joseffy, Lilli Lehmann, Max Heinrich, and Victor
Herbert used to gather. Follow Alfred Hertz and
you will be in excellent company in a double sense.
Then watch him consume a plateful of Viennese
pastry. If you have ever seen Emmy Destinn or
Feodor Chaliapine eat you will feel that justice has
been done to a meal. I once sat with the Russian
bass for twelve hours, all of which time he was
eating or drinking. He began with six plates of
steaming onion soup (cooked with cheese and
toast). The old New Year's eve festivities at the
Gadski-Tauschers' resembled the storied banquets
of the middle ages.... Boars' heads, meat
pies, <i>salade mac&eacute;doine</i>, <i>coeur de palmier</i>, <i>hollandaise</i>
were washed down with magnums and quarts
of Irroy brut, 1900, Pol Roger, Chambertin,
graceful Bohemian crystal goblets of Liebfraumilch
and Johannisberger Schloss-Auslese.
Mary Garden once sent a jewelled gift to the <i>chef</i>
at the Ritz-Carlton in return for a superb fish
sauce which he had contrived for her. H. E.
Krehbiel says that Brignoli "probably ate as no
tenor ever ate before or since&mdash;ravenously as a
Prussian dragoon after a fast." <i>P&ecirc;che Melba</i> has
become a stable article on many menus in many
cities in many lands. Agnes G. Murphy, in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
biography of Mme. Melba, says that one day the
singer, Joachim, and a party of friends stopped
at a peasant's cottage near Bergamo, where they
were regaled with such delicious macaroni that
Melba persuaded her friends to return another day
and wait while the peasant taught her the exact
method of preparing the dish. In at least one
New York restaurant <i>oeuf Toscanini</i> is to be found
on the bill. I have heard Olive Fremstad complain
of the cooking in this hotel in Paris, or that
hotel in New York, or the other hotel in Munich,
and when she found herself in an apartment of her
own she immediately set about to cook a few special
dishes for herself.</p>

<p>Two musicians I know not only keep restaurants
in New York, but actually prepare the dinners
themselves. One of them is at the same time a
singer in the Metropolitan Opera Company.
Have you seen Bernard B&eacute;gu&eacute; standing before his
cook stove preparing food for his patrons? His
huge form, clad in white, viewed through the
open doorway connecting the dining room with the
kitchen, almost conceals the great stove, but occasionally
you can catch sight of the pots and
pans, the <i>casseroles</i> of <i>pot-au-feu</i>, the roasting
chicken, the filets of sole, all the ingredients of a
dinner, <i>cuisine bourgeoise</i> ... and after dining,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
you can hear B&eacute;gu&eacute; sing the Uncle-priest in
<i>Madama Butterfly</i> at the Opera House.</p>

<p>Or have you seen Giacomo (and have not
Meyerbeer and Puccini been bearers of this
name?) Pogliani turning from the <i>spaghetti</i> theme
chromatically to that of the <i>risotto</i>, the most succulent
and appetizing <i>risotto</i> to be tasted this side
of Bonvecchiati's in Venice ... or the <i>polenta</i>
with <i>funghi</i>.... But, best of all, the roasts, and
were it not that the Prince Troubetskoy is a
vegetarian you would fancy that he came to
Pogliani's for these viands. And it must not be
forgotten that this supreme cook is&mdash;or was&mdash;a
bassoon player of the first rank, that he is a
graduate of the Milan Conservatory. The bassoon
is a difficult instrument. It is sometimes
called the "comedian of the orchestra," but there
are few who can play it at all, still fewer who can
play it well. Bassoonists are highly paid and
they are in demand. Walter Damrosch used to
say that when he was engaging a bassoon player
he would ask him to play a passage from the
bassoon part in <i>Scheherazade</i>. If he could play
that, he could play anything else written for his
instrument. Pogliani gave up the bassoon for the
fork, spoon, and saucepan. Like Prospero he
buried his magic wand and in Viafora's cartoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the instrument lies idle in the cobwebs.</p>

<p>Charles Santley's "Reminiscences" and "Student
and Singer" are full of references to food:
"ox-hearts, stuffed with onions," "a joint of
meat, well cooked, with a bright brown crust which
prevented the juices escaping," "a splendid shoulder
of mutton, a picture to behold, and a <i>peas pudding</i>,"
and "whaffles" are a few of the dishes referred
to with enthusiasm. In America a newspaper
gravely informed its readers that "Santley
says squash pie is the best thing to sing on he
knows!" Santley was a true pantophagist, but
he was worsted in his first encounter with the
American oyster: "I had often heard of the celebrated
American oyster, which half a dozen people
had tried to swallow without success, and was
anxious to learn if the story were founded on fact.
Cummings conducted me to a cellar in Broadway,
where, upon his order, a waiter produced two
plates, on which were half a dozen objects, about
the size and shape of the sole of an ordinary lady's
shoe, on each of which lay what appeared to me
to be a very bilious tongue, accompanied by
smaller plates containing shredded white cabbage
raw. I did not admire the look of the repast, but
I never discard food on account of looks. I took
up an oyster and tried to get it into my mouth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
but it was of no use; I tried to ram it in with the
butt-end of the fork, but all to no purpose, and I
had to drop it, and, to the great indignation of the
waiter, paid and left the oysters for him to dispose
of as he might like best. I presume those
oysters are eaten, but I cannot imagine by whom;
I have rarely seen a mouth capable of the necessary
expansion. I soon found out that there
were plenty of delicious oysters in the States
within the compass of ordinary jaws."</p>

<p>J. H. Mapleson says in his "Memoirs" that at
the Opera at Lodi, where he made his d&eacute;but as a
tenor, refreshments of all kinds were served to the
audience between the acts and every box was furnished
with a little kitchen for cooking macaroni
and baking or frying pastry. The wine of the
country was drunk freely, not out of glasses, but
"in classical fashion&mdash;from bowls." Mapleson
also tells us that Del Puente was a "very tolerable
cook." On one trying occasion he prepared
macaroni for his impressario. Michael Kelly declares
that the sight of Signor St. Giorgio entering
a fruit shop to eat peaches, nectarines, and a pineapple,
was really what stimulated him to study for
a career on the stage. "While my mouth watered,
I asked myself why, if I assiduously studied music,
I should not be able to earn money enough to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
lounge about in fruit-shops, and eat peaches and
pineapples as well as Signor St. Giorgio...."</p>

<p>Lillian Russell is a good cook. I can recommend
her recipe for the preparation of mushrooms:
"Put a lump of butter in a chafing dish
(or a saucepan) and a slice of Spanish onion and
the mushrooms minus the stems; let them simmer
until they are all deliciously tender and the juice
has run from them&mdash;about twenty minutes should
be enough&mdash;then add a cupful of cream and let
this boil. As a last touch squeeze in the juice of
a lemon." When Luisa Tetrazzini was going mad
with a flute in our vicinity she varied the monotony
of her life by sending pages of her favourite recipes
to the Sunday yellow press. Unfortunately, I
neglected to make a collection of this series. A
passion for cooking caused the death of Naldi, a
buffo singer of the early Nineteenth Century.
Michael Kelly tells the story: "His ill stars took
him to Paris, where, one day, just before dinner,
at his friend Garcia's house, in the year 1821, he
was showing the method of cooking by steam, with
a portable apparatus for that purpose; unfortunately,
in consequence of some derangement of
the machinery, an explosion took place, by which
he was instantaneously killed." Almost everybody
knows some story or other about a <i>virtuoso</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
trapped into dining and asked to perform after
dinner by his host. Kelly relates one of the first:
"Fischer, the great oboe player, whose minuet
was then all the rage ... being very much
pressed by a nobleman to sup with him after the
opera, declined the invitation, saying that he was
usually much fatigued, and made it a rule never to
go out after the evening's performance. The
noble lord would, however, take no denial, and assured
Fischer that he did not ask him professionally,
but merely for the gratification of his society
and conversation. Thus urged and encouraged,
he went; he had not, however, been many
minutes in the house of the consistent nobleman,
before his lordship approached him, and said, 'I
hope, Mr. Fischer, you have brought your oboe in
your pocket.'&mdash;'No, my Lord,' said Fischer, 'my
oboe never sups.' He turned on his heel, and instantly
left the house, and no persuasion could
ever induce him to return to it." You perhaps
have heard rumours that Giuseppe Campanari prefers
<i>spaghetti</i> to Mozart, especially when he cooks
it himself. When this baritone was a member of
the Metropolitan Opera Company his paraphernalia
for preparing his favourite food went everywhere
with him on tour. Heinrich Conried (or
was it Maurice Grau?) once tried to take <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>advantage
of this weakness, according to a story
often related by the late Algernon St. John Brenon.
Campanari was to appear as Kothner in <i>Die Meistersinger</i>,
a character with no singing to do after
the first act, although he appears in the procession
in the third act. The singer told his impressario
that he saw no reason why he should remain to the
end and explained that he would leave his costume
for a chorus man to don to represent him in the
final episode. "What would the Master say?"
demanded Conried, wringing his hands. "Would
he approve of such a proceeding? No. That
would not be truth! That would not be art!"
Campanari was obdurate. The Herr Direktor became
reflective. He was silent for a moment and
then he continued: "If you will stay for the last
act you will find in your room a little supper,
a bottle of wine, and a box of cigars, which you
may consume while you are waiting." In sooth
when Campanari entered his dressing room after
the first act of Wagner's comic opera he found that
his director had kept his word.... The baritone
ate the supper, drank the wine, put the cigars in
his pocket ... and went home!</p>

<p>If some singers are good cooks it does not follow
that all good cooks are singers. Benjamin
Lumley, in his "Reminiscences of the Opera," tells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the sad story of the Countess of Cannazaro's cook,
which should serve as a lesson to housemaids who
are desirous of becoming moving picture stars.
"This worthy man, excellent no doubt as a <i>chef</i>,
took it into his head that he was a vocalist of the
highest order, and that he only wanted opportunity
to earn musical distinction. His strange
fancy came to the knowledge of Rubini, and it was
arranged that a performance should take place in
the morning, in which the cook's talent should be
fairly tested. Certainly every chance was afforded
him. Not only was he encouraged by
Rubini and Lablache (whose gravity on the occasion
was wonderful), but by a few others, Costa
included, as instrumentalists. The failure was
miserable, ridiculous, as everybody expected."
Frederick Crowest describes a certain Count Castel
de Maria who had a spit that played tunes,
"and so regulated and indicated the condition of
whatever was hung upon it to roast. By a singular
mechanical contrivance this wonderful spit
would strike up an appropriate tune whenever a
joint had hung sufficiently long on its particular
roast. Thus, <i>Oh! the roast beef of Old England</i>,
when a sirloin had turned and hung its appointed
time. At another air, a leg of mutton, <i>&agrave; l'Anglaise</i>
would be found excellent; while some other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
tune would indicate that a fowl <i>&agrave; la Flamande</i> was
cooked to a nicety and needed removal from the
fowl roast."</p>

<p>To Crowest, too, I am indebted for a list of
beverages and eatables which certain singers held
in superstitious awe as capable of refreshing their
voices. Formes swore by a pot of good porter
and Wachtel is said to have trusted to the yolk of
an egg beaten up with sugar to make sure of his
high Cs. The Swedish tenor, Labatt, declared
that two salted cucumbers gave the voice the true
metallic ring. Walter drank cold black coffee
during a performance; Southeim took snuff and
cold lemonade; Steger, beer; Niemann, champagne,
slightly warmed, (Huneker once saw Niemann
drinking cocktails from a beer glass; he
sang Siegmund at the opera the next night);
Tichatschek, mulled claret; R&uuml;bgam drank mead;
Nachbaur ate bonbons; Arabanek believed in Gampoldskirchner
wine. Mlle. Brann-Brini took beer
and <i>cafe au lait</i>, but she also firmly believed in
champagne and would never dare venture the great
duet in the fourth act of <i>Les Huguenots</i> without a
bottle of Mo&euml;t Cr&eacute;mant Rose. Giardini being
asked his opinion of Banti, previous to her arrival
in England, said: "She is the first singer in Italy
and drinks a bottle of wine every day." Malibran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
believed in the efficacy of porter. She made her
last appearances in opera in Balfe's <i>Maid of Artois</i>
during the fall of 1836 in London. On the first
night she was in anything but good physical condition
and the author of "Musical Recollections
of the Last Half-Century" tells how she pulled
herself through: "She remembered that an immense
trial awaited her in the finale of the third
act; and finding her strength giving way, she sent
for Mr. Balfe and Mr. Bunn, and told them that
unless they did as they were bid, after all the previous
success, the end might result in failure; but
she said, 'Manage to let me have a pot of porter
somehow or other before I have to sing, and I will
get you an encore which will bring down the house.'
How to manage this was difficult; for the scene was
so set that it seemed scarcely possible to hand her
up 'the pewter' without its being witnessed by the
audience. After much consultation, Malibran
having been assured that her wish should be fulfilled,
it was arranged that the pot of porter
should be handed up to her through a trap in the
stage at the moment when Jules had thrown himself
on her body, supposing that life had fled; and
Mr. Templeton was drilled into the manner in
which he should so manage to conceal the necessary
arrangement, that the audience would never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
suspect what was going on. At the right moment
a friendly hand put the foaming pewter through
the stage, to be swallowed at a draught, and success
was won!... Malibran, however, had not overestimated
her own strength. She knew that it
wanted but this fillip to carry her through. She
had resolved to have an encore, and she had it, in
such a fashion as made the roof of 'Old Drury'
ring as it had never rung before. On the repetition
of the opera and afterwards, a different arrangement
of the stage was made, and a property
calabash containing a pot of porter was used; but
although the same result was constantly won, Malibran
always said it was not half so 'nice,' nor did
her anything like the good it would have done if
she could only have had it out of the pewter."
Clara Louise Kellogg in her very lively "Memoirs"
publishes a similar tale of another singer:
"It was told of Grisi that when she was growing
old and severe exertion told on her she always,
after her fall as Lucrezia Borgia, drank a glass of
beer sent up to her through the floor, lying with
her back half turned to the audience." Miss Kellogg
complains of the breaths of the tenors she
sang with: "Stigelli usually exhaled an aroma of
lager beer; while the good Mazzoleni invariably ate
from one to two pounds of cheese the day he was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
sing. He said it strengthened his voice. Many
of them affected garlic." It is necessary, of
course, that a singer should know what foods
agree with him. He must keep himself in excellent
physical condition: small wonder that many
artists are superstitious in this regard.</p>

<p>Charles Santley, who was so fond of eating and
drinking himself, offers some excellent advice
on the subject in "Student and Singer": "How
the voice is produced or where, except that it is
through the passage of the throat, is unimportant;
it is reasonable to say that the passage must
be kept clear, otherwise the sound proceeding from
it will not be clear. I have known many instances
of singers undergoing very disagreeable operations
on their throats for chronic diseases of various
descriptions; now, my observation and experience
assure me that, in ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred, the root of the evil is chronic inattention
to food and raiment. It is a common
thing to hear a singer say, 'I never touch such-and-such
food on the days I sing.' My dear
young friend, unless you are an absolute idiot,
you would not partake of anything on the days
you sing which might disagree with you, or over-tax
your digestive powers; it is on the days you
do not sing you ought more particularly to exercise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
your judgment and self-denial. I do not offer
the pinched-up pilgarlic who dines off a wizened
apple and a crust of bread as a model for
imitation; at the same time, I warn you seriously
against following the example of the gobbling
glutton who swallows every dish that tempts his
palate."</p>

<p>Rossini, after he had composed <i>Guillaume Tell</i>,
retired. He was thirty-seven, a man in perfect
health, and he lived thirty-nine years longer, to
the age of seventy-six, yet he never wrote another
opera, hardly indeed did he dip his pen in ink at
all. These facts have seriously disconcerted his
biographers, who are at a loss to assign reasons
for his actions. W. F. Apthorp gives us an ingenious
explanation in "The Opera Past and
Present." He says that after <i>Tell</i> Rossini's pride
would not allow him to return to his earlier Italian
manner, while the hard work needed to produce
more <i>Tells</i> was more than his laziness could stomach....
Perhaps, but it must be remembered
that Rossini did not retire to his library or his
music room, but to his kitchen. The simple explanation
is that he preferred cooking to composing,
a fact easy to believe (I myself vastly prefer
cooking to writing). He could cook <i>risotto</i> better
than any one else he knew. He was dubbed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
"hippopotamus in trousers," and for six years before
he died he could not see his toes, he was so fat.
Sir Arthur Sullivan relates an anecdote which
shows that Rossini was conscious of his grossness.
Once in Paris Sullivan introduced Chorley to Rossini,
when the Italian said, "<i>Je vois, avec plaisir,
que monsieur n'a pas de ventre</i>." Chorley indeed
was noticeably slender. Rossini could write more
easily, so his biographers tell us, when he was under
the influence of champagne or some light wine.
His provision merchant once begged him for an
autographed portrait. The composer gave it to
him with the inscription, "To my stomach's best
friend." The tradesman used this souvenir as an
advertisement and largely increased his business
thereby, as such a testimonial from such an acknowledged
epicure had a very definite value. J.
B. Weckerlin asserts that when Rossini dined at
the Rothschild's he first went to the kitchen to pay
his respects to the <i>chef</i>, to look over the menu, and
even to discuss the various dishes, after which he
ascended to the drawing room to greet the family
of the rich banker. Mme. Alboni told Weckerlin
that Rossini had dedicated a piece of music to the
Rothschild's <i>chef</i>.</p>

<p>Anfossi, we are informed, could compose only
when he was surrounded by smoking fowls and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Bologna sausages; their fumes seemed to inflame
his imagination, to feed his muse; his brain was
stimulated first through his nose and then through
his stomach. When Gluck wrote music he betook
himself to the open fields, accompanied by at least
two bottles of champagne. Salieri told Michael
Kelly that a comic opera of Gluck's being performed
at the Elector Palatine's theatre, at
Schwetzingen, his Electoral Highness was struck
with the music, and inquired who had composed
it; on being informed that he was an honest German
who loved <i>old wine</i>, his Highness immediately
ordered him a tun of Hock. Beethoven, on the
contrary, seems to have fed on his thoughts occasionally,
although there is evidence that he was not
only a good eater but also a good cook (the
mothers of both Beethoven and Schubert were
cooks in domestic service). There is a story related
of him that about the time he was composing
the <i>Sixth Symphony</i> he walked into a Viennese
restaurant and ordered dinner. While it was
being prepared, he became involved in thought,
and when the waiter returned to serve him, he
said: "Thank you, I have dined!" laid the price
of the dinner on the table, and took his departure.
Gr&eacute;try, too, lost his appetite when he was composing.
There are numerous references to eating and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
drinking in Mendelssohn's letters. His particular
preferences, according to Sir George Grove,
were for rice milk and cherry pie. Dussek was a
famous eater, and it is said that his ruling passion
eventually killed him. His patron, the Prince of
Benevento, paid the composer eight hundred napoleons
a year, with a free table for three persons,
at which, as a matter of fact, one person
usually presided. A musical historian tells us that
in the summer of 1797 he was dining with three
friends at the Ship Tavern in Greenwich, when
the waiter came and laid a cloth for one person at
the next table, placing thereon a dish of boiled
eels, one of fried flounders, a bowled fowl, a dish
of veal cutlets, and a couple of tarts. Then Dussek
entered and made away with the lot, leaving
but the bones! In W. T. Parke's "Musical
Memoirs" justice is done to the appetite of one
C. F. Baumgarten, for many years leader of the
band and composer at Covent Garden Theatre.
Once at supper after the play he and a friend ate
a full-grown hare between them. He would never
condescend to drink out of anything but a quart
pot. On one occasion, at the request of his
friends, Baumgarten was weighed before and after
dinner. There was eight pounds difference! William
Shield, the composer who wrote many operas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
for Covent Garden Theatre, beginning aptly
enough with one called <i>The Flitch of Bacon</i>, was
something of an eater. Parke tells how at a dinner
one evening there was a brace of partridges.
The hostess handed Shield one of these to carve
and absent-mindedly he set to and finished it,
while the other guests were forced to make shift
with the other partridge. Handel was a great
eater. He was called the "Saxon Giant," as a
tribute to his genius, but the phrase might have
had a satirical reference to his enormous bulk.
Intending to dine one day at a certain tavern, he
ordered beforehand a dinner for three. At the
hour appointed he sat down to the table and expressed
astonishment that the dinner was not
brought up. The waiter explained that he would
begin serving when the company arrived. "Den
pring up de tinner brestissimo," replied Handel,
"I am de gombany." Lulli never forsook the <i>casserole</i>.
Paganini was as good a cook as he was
a violinist. Parke tells a story of Weichsell, not
too celebrated a musician, but the father of Mrs.
Billington and Charles Weichsell, the violinist:
"He would occasionally supersede the labours of
his cook, and pass a whole day in preparing his
favourite dish, rump-steaks, for the stewing pan;
and after the delicious viand had been placed on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the dinner-table, together with early green peas
of high price, if it happened that the sauce was not
to his liking he has been known to throw rump-steaks,
and green peas, and all, out of the window,
whilst his wife and children thought themselves fortunate
in not being thrown after them."</p>

<p>Is there a cooking theme in <i>Siegfried</i> to describe
Mime's brewing? Lavignac and others, who have
listed the <i>Ring motive</i>, have neglected to catalogue
it, but it is mentioned by Old Fogy. Practically
a whole act is taken up in <i>Louise</i> with the preparation
for and consumption of a dinner. Scarpia
eats in <i>Tosca</i> and the heroine kills him with a
table knife. There is much talk of food in <i>H&auml;nsel
und Gretel</i> and there is a supper in <i>The Merry
Wives of Windsor</i>. There are drinking songs in
<i>Don Giovanni</i>, <i>Lucrezia Borgia</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>La Traviata</i>,
<i>Girofl&eacute;-Girofla</i>.... The reference to whiskey
and soda in <i>Madama Butterfly</i> is celebrated.
J. E. Cox, the author of "Musical Recollections,"
describes Herr Pischek in the supper scene of <i>Don
Giovanni</i> as "out-heroding Herod by swallowing
glass after glass of champagne like a sot, and
gnawing the drumstick of a fowl, which he held
across his mouth with his fingers, just as any of
his own middle-class countrymen may be seen any
day of the week all the year round at the <i>mit-tag</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
or <i>abend-essen</i> feeding at one of their largely frequented
<i>tables-d'h&ocirc;te</i>." Eating or drinking on the
stage is always fraught with danger, as Charles
Santley once discovered during Papageno's supper
scene in <i>The Magic Flute</i>: "The supper which
Tamino commands for the hungry Papageno consisted
of pasteboard imitations of good things, but
the cup contained real wine, a small draught of
which I found refreshing on a hot night in July,
amid the dust and heat of the stage. On the
occasion in question I was putting the cup to lips,
when I heard somebody call to me from the wings;
I felt very angry at the interruption, and was
just about to swallow the wine when I heard an
anxious call not to drink. Suspecting something
was wrong, I pretended to drink, and deposited the
cup on the table. Immediately after the scene I
made inquiries about the reason for the caution I
received, and was informed that as each night the
carpenters, who had no right to it, finished what
remained of the wine before the property men,
whose perquisite it was, could lay hold of the cup,
the latter, to give their despoilers a lesson, had
mingled castor-oil with my drink!"</p>

<p>A young husband of my acquaintance once bemoaned
to me the fact that his wife seemed destined
to become a great singer. "She is such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
remarkable cook!" he explained to account for his
despondency. I reassured him: "She will cook
with renewed energy when she begins to sing <i>Sieglinde</i>
and <i>Tosca</i>.... She will practise <i>Vissi
d'Arte</i> over the gumbo soup and <i>Du herstes
Wunder</i>! while the Frankfurters are sizzling. Her
trills, her chromatic scales, and her <i>messa di voce</i>
will come right in the kitchen; she will equalize her
scale and learn to breathe correctly bending over
the oven. It is even likely that she will improve
her knowledge of <i>portamento</i> while she is washing
dishes. When she can prepare a succulent roast
suckling pig she will be able to sing <i>Ocean, thou
mighty monster</i>! and she will understand <i>Abscheulicher</i>
when she understands the mysteries of old-fashioned
strawberry shortcake. If you hear her
shrieking <i>Suicidio</i>! invoking Agamemnon, or appealing
to the <i>Casta Diva</i> among the kettles and
pots be not alarmed.... For the love you bear
of good food, man, do not discourage your wife's
ambition. The more she loves to sing, the better
she will cook!"</p>

<h2><a name="An_Interrupted_Conversation" id="An_Interrupted_Conversation"></a>An Interrupted Conversation</h2>


<p>Ordinarily one does not learn things
about oneself from Edmund Gosse, but my
discovery that I am a Pyrrhonist is due to
that literary man. A Pyrrhonist, says Mr. Gosse,
is "one who doubts whether it is worth while to
struggle against the trend of things. The man
who continues to cross the road leisurely, although
the cyclists' bells are ringing, is a Pyrrhonist&mdash;and
in a very special sense, for the ancient philosopher
who gives his name to the class made himself
conspicuous by refusing to get out of the way
of careering chariots." Now the most unfamiliar
friend I have ever walked with knows my extreme
impassivity at the corners of streets, remembers
the careless attitude with which I saunter from
kerb to kerb, whether it be across the Grand Boulevard,
Piccadilly, or Fifth Avenue. Only once
has this nonchalant defiance of traffic caused me
to come to even temporary grief; that was on the
last night of the year 1913, when, in crossing
Broadway, I became entangled, God knows how,
in the wheels of a swiftly passing vehicle, and
found myself, top hat and all, in the most ignominious
position before I was well aware of what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
had really happened. Then a policeman stooped
over me, book and pencil in hand, and another
held the chauffeur of the victorious taxi-cab at
bay some yards further up the street. But I was
not hurt and I waved them all away with a magnanimous
gesture.... It is owing to this habit
of mine that I often make interesting <i>rencontres</i>
in the middle of streets. It accounts, in fact, for
my running, quite absent-mindedly, plump into
Dickinson Sitgreaves, who is more American than
his name sounds, one August day in Paris.</p>

<p>It was one of those charming days which make
August perhaps the most delightful month to spend
in Paris, although the facts are not known to
tourists. Many a sly French pair, however, bored
with Trouville, or the season at Aix, take advantage
of the allurements of a Paris August to return
surreptitiously to the boulevards. On this
particular day almost all the seduction of an October
day was in the air, a splendid dull warm-cool
crispness, which filtered down through the
faded chestnut leaves from the sunlight, and left
pale splotches of purple and orange on the
<i>trottoirs</i> ... a really marvellous day, which I
was spending in that most excellent occupation in
Paris of gazing into shops and, passing caf&eacute;s, staring
into the faces of those who sat on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span><i>terrasses</i>....
But this is an occupation for one
alone; so, when I met Sitgreaves, we joined a <i>terrasse</i>
ourselves. We were near the Napolitain
and there he and I sat down and began to talk as
only we two can talk together after long separation.
He explained in the beginning how I
had interrupted him.... There was a <i>fille</i>, some
little Polish beauty who had captivated his senses
a day or so before, brought to him quite by accident
in an hotel where the <i>patron</i> furnished his
clients with such pleasure as the town and his address
book afforded.... I knew the <i>patron</i> myself,
a fluent, amusing sort of person, who had been
a <i>cuirassier</i> and who resembled Mayol ... a <i>caf&eacute;-concert</i>
proprietor of an hotel.... It was his
boast that he had never disappointed a client and
it is certain that he would promise anything.
Some have said that his stock in trade was one
pretty girl, who assumed costumes, ages, hair, and
accents, to please whatever demand was made upon
her, but this I do not believe. There must have
been at least two of them. The Grand Duchess
Anastasia, it was rumoured, had dined with Marcel
at one time, in his little hotel, and certainly
one king had been seen to go there, and one member
of the English royal family, but Marcel remained
simple and obliging.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"When will you look up the little <i>Polonaise</i>?"
I asked, as we sipped <i>Amer Picon</i> and stared with
fresh interest at each new boot and ankle that
passed. Paris in August is like another place in
May.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come along?" queried Sitgreaves
in reply, "and we could go at once....
Oh, I know that you are in no mood for pleasure.
You see the point is that I shall have to wait.
Marcel will have to send for the <i>fille</i>. It is a bore
to wait in a room with red curtains and a picture
of <i>Amour et Psyche</i> on the walls.... What have
you been doing?" He paid the <i>consommation</i>
and started to leave without waiting for a reply,
because he knew of my complaisance. I rose with
him and we walked down the boulevard.</p>

<p>"What is there to do in Paris in August but
to enjoy oneself?" I asked. "I have made friends
with an <i>apache</i> and his <i>gigolette</i>. We eat bread
and cheese and drink bad wine on the fortifications....
In the afternoon I walk. Sometimes I go to
the Luxembourg gardens to hear the band bray
sad music, or to watch the little boys play <i>diavolo</i>,
or sail their tiny boats about the fountain pond;
sometimes I walk quite silently up the Avenue
Gabriel, with its <i>triste</i> line of trees, and dream
that I am a Grand Duke; in the evening there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
again the <i>terrasses</i> of the caf&eacute;s, dinner in Montmartre
at the Clou, or the Cou-Cou, a <i>revue</i> at La
Cigale, but it is all governed, my day and my night,
by what happens and by whom I meet.... Have
you seen Jacques Blanche's portrait of Nijinsky?"</p>

<p>"I think it is Picasso that interests me now,"
Sitgreaves was saying. "He puts wood and pieces
of paper into his composition; architecture, that's
what it is.... I don't go to Blanche's any more.
It's too delightfully perfect, the atmosphere there....
The books are by all the famous writers, and
they are all dedicated to Blanche; the pictures are
all of the great men of today, and they are all
painted by Blanche; the music is played by the
best musicians.... Do you know, I think
Blanche is the one man who has made a successful
profession of being an amateur&mdash;unless one
excepts Robert de la Condamine.... You can
scarcely call a man who does so much a dilettante.
Yes, I think he is an amateur in the best sense."</p>

<p>"I met the Countess of Jena there the other
day," I responded. "She had scarcely left the
room before three people volunteered, <i>sans rancune</i>,
to tell her story. She is a devout Catholic,
and her husband contrived in some way to substitute
a spy for the priest in the confessional. He
acquired an infinite amount of information, but it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
didn't do him any good. She is so witty that
every one invites her everywhere in spite of her
reputation, and he is left to dine alone at the
Meurice. Dull men simply are not tolerated in
Paris.</p>

<p>"It was at Blanche's last year that I met
George Moore," I continued. "You know I have
just seen him in London. He is at work on <i>The
Apostle</i>, making a novel of it, to be called 'The
Brook Kerith.' ... For a time he thought of finishing
it up as a play because a novel meant a
visit to Palestine and that was distasteful to him,
but it finally became a novel. He went to Palestine
and stayed six weeks, just long enough to find
a monastery and to study the lay of the country.
For he says, truly enough, that one cannot imagine
landscapes; one does not know whether there is a
high or low horizon. There may be a brook which
all the characters must cross. It is necessary to
see these things. Besides he had to find a monastery....
He told me of his thrill when he discovered
an order of monks living on a narrow ledge
of cliff, with 500 feet sheer rise and descent above
and below it ... and when he had found this
his work was done and he returned to England to
write the book, a reaction, for he told me that he
was getting tired of being personal in literature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
The book will exhibit a conflict between two types:
Christ, the disappointed mystic, and Paul; Christ,
who sees that there is no good to be served in saving
the world by his death, and Paul, full of hope,
idealism, and illusions. It is the drama of the
conflict between the nature which is affected by
externals and that which is not, he told me."</p>

<p>"It's a subject for Anatole France," said Sitgreaves.
"Moore, in my opinion, is not a novelist.
His great achievements are his memoirs. I was
interested in 'Evelyn Innes' and 'Esther Waters,'
but something was lacking. There is nothing
lacking in the three volumes of 'Hail and Farewell.'
They grow in interest. Moore has found
his <i>m&eacute;tier</i>."</p>

<p>"But he insists," I explained, before the door
of the little hotel, "that 'Hail and Farewell' is a
novel. He is infuriated when some one suggests
that it is a book after the manner of, say, 'The
Reminiscences of Lady Randolph Churchill.' ..."</p>

<p>We entered and walked up the little staircase.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that the incidents are untrue?"</p>

<p>We were at the door of the <i>concierge</i> and there
stood Marcel, his apron spread neatly over his
ample paunch. It was early in the afternoon and
the room beyond him, sometimes filled with possibilities
for customers, was empty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Ah, monsieur est revenu!</i>" he exclaimed in his
piping voice. "<i>C'est pour la petite Polonaise
sans doute que monsieur revient?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>," answered Sitgreaves, "<i>faut-il attendre
longtemps?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Mais non, monsieur, un petit moment. Elle
habite en face. Je vais envoyer le gar&ccedil;on la
chercher tout de suite. Et pour monsieur, votre
ami?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Je ne desire rien</i>," I replied.</p>

<p>Marcel bowed humbly.... "<i>Comme monsieur
voudra.</i>" Then a doubt assailed him. "<i>Peut-&ecirc;tre
que la petite Polonaise vous suffira &agrave; tous les
deux?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Jamais de la vie!</i>" I shouted, "<i>Fl&ucirc;te, Mercure,
allez! Je suis puceau!</i>"</p>

<p>Marcel was equal to this. "<i>Et ta soeur?</i>" he
demanded as he disappeared down the staircase.</p>

<p>He had put us meanwhile in the very chamber
with the red curtains and the picture of Cupid and
Psyche that Sitgreaves had described. Perhaps
all the rooms were similarly decorated. I lounged
on the bed while Sitgreaves sat on a chair and
smoked....</p>

<p>I answered his last question, "No, they are
true, but there is selection and form."</p>

<p>"While other memoirs have neither selection nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
form and usually are not altogether accurate in
the bargain...."</p>

<p>"Especially Madame Melba's...."</p>

<p>"Especially," agreed Sitgreaves delightedly,
"Madame Melba's."</p>

<p>"Moore is really right," I went on. "He says
that some people insist that Balzac was greater
than Turgeniev, because the Frenchman took his
characters from imagination, the Russian his from
life. You will remember, however, that Edgar
Saltus says, 'The manufacture of fiction from
facts was begun by Balzac.' Moore's point is
that all great writers write from observation.
There is no other way. A character may have
more or less resemblance to the original; it may
be derived and bear a different name; still there
must have been something.... In a letter which
Moore once wrote me stands the phrase, 'Memory
is the mother of the Muses.' 'Hail and Farewell'
is just as much a work of imagination, according
to Moore, as 'A Nest of Noblemen' or 'Les Illusions
Perdues.'"</p>

<p>"Of course," admitted Sitgreaves. "No
writer but what has suffered from the recognition
of his characters. Dickens got into trouble. Oscar
Wilde is said to have done himself in 'Dorian
Gray,' and Meredith's models for 'The Tragic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Comedians' and 'Diana of the Crossways' are
well known."</p>

<p>"All Moore has done is to call his characters
by their real names and he has reported their
conversations as he remembered them, but, mind
you, he has not put into the book all their conversations,
or even all the people he knew at that
period. Arthur Symons, for instance, a great
friend of Moore's at that time, is scarcely mentioned,
and with reason: he has no part in the
form of the book; its plot is not concerned with
him.</p>

<p>"All artists create only in the image of the
things they have seen, reduced to terms of art
through their imagination. The paintings of Mina
Loy seem to the beholder the strange creations of
a vagrant fancy. I remember one picture of hers
in which an Indian girl stands poised before an
oriental palace, the most fantastic of palaces, it
would seem. But the artist explained to me that
it was simply the fa&ccedil;ade of Hagenbeck's menagerie
in Hamburg, seen with an imaginative eye. The
girl was a model.... One day on the beach at the
Lido she saw a young man in a bathing suit lying
stretched on the sand with his head in the lap of a
beautiful woman. Other women surrounded the
two. The group immediately suggested a composition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to her. She went home and painted. She
took the young man's bathing suit off and gave
him wings; the women she dressed in lovely floating
robes, and she called the picture, <i>l'Amour Dorlot&eacute;
par les Belles Dames</i>.</p>

<p>"And once I asked Frank Harris to explain to
me the origin of his vivid story, 'Montes the Matador.'
'It's too simple,' he said, 'the model for
Montes was a little Mexican greaser whom I met
in Kansas. He was one of many in charge of
cattle shipped up from Mexico and down from the
States. All the white cattle men, the gringos,
held him in great contempt. But,' continued
Harris, speaking deliberately with his beautifully
modulated voice, and his eyes twinkling with the
memory of the thing, 'I soon found that the
greaser's contempt for the gringos was immeasureably
greater than their's for him. "Bah," he
would say, "they know nothing." And it was so.
He could go into a cattle car on a pitch dark
night and make the bulls stand up, a feat that
none of the white men would have attempted. I
asked him how he did this and he told me the
answer in three words, "I know them." He could
go into a herd of cattle just let loose together and
pick out their leader immediately, pick him out
before the cattle themselves had! There was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
origin of "Montes the Matador." He was
named, of course, after the famous <i>torero</i> described
by Gautier in his "Voyage en Espagne."
When I was in Madrid sometime later I went to a
number of bull-fights before I put the story together.'
'But,' I asked Harris, 'Is it possible
for an <i>espada</i> to stand in the bull ring with his
back to the bull, during a charge, as you have
made him do frequently in the story?' 'Of
course not,' he answered me at once, smiling his
frankly malevolent smile, 'Of course not. That
part was put in to show how much the public will
stand for in a work of fiction. I believe one of
the <i>espadas</i> tried it some time after the book appeared
and was immediately killed.'</p>

<p>"Fiction, history, poetry, criticism, at their
best, are all the same thing. When they inflame
the imagination and stir the pulse they are identical:
all creative work. It does not matter what
a man writes about. It matters how he writes it.
Subject is nothing. Should we regard Velasquez
as less important than Murillo because the former
painted portraits of contemporaries, whom in his
fashion he criticized, while the Spanish Bouguereau
disguised his models as the Virgin? Walter
Pater's description of the <i>Monna Lisa</i> would live
if the picture disappeared. Indeed it has created<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
a factitious interest in da Vinci's masterwork.
Even more might be said for Huysmans's description
of Moreau's <i>Salom&eacute;</i>, which actually puts the
figures in the picture in motion! The critic, the
historian at their best are creative artists as the
writers of fiction are creative artists. Should we
regard, for example, 'Imperial Purple' less a work
of creative art than 'The Rise of Silas Lapham'?"</p>

<p>"I am getting your meaning more and more,"
said Sitgreaves. "And it occurs to me that perhaps
I have been unjust in rating Moore low as
a novelist. Perhaps I should have said that he is
more successful in those books which depend more
on his memory and less on his imaginative instinct.
He cannot, after all, have known Jesus and
Paul...."</p>

<p>"You are quite wrong," I said. "At least from
his point of view. He says that he knows Paul
better than he has ever known any one else. He
even finds hair on Paul's chest. He can describe
Paul, I believe, to the last mole. He knows his
favourite colours, and whether he prefers artichokes
to alligator pears. As for Christ, everybody
professes to know Christ these days. Since
the world has become distinctly un-Christian
it has become comparatively easy to discuss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Christ. He is regarded as an historical character,
and a much more simple one than Napoleon.
I have heard anarchists in bar-rooms talk about
him by the hour, sometimes very graphically and
always with a certain amount of wit. No, it is all
the same.... Moore, now that he has been to
Palestine and read the gospels, feels as well acquainted
with Christ and Paul as he does with
Edward Martyn and Yeats and Lady Gregory."</p>

<p>"I must fall back on the personal then," said
Sitgreaves, now really at bay, "and say that I am
less moved and interested when Moore is describing
Evelyn Innes, than when he tells of his affair with
Doris at Orelay."</p>

<p>"I am glad that you mentioned 'Evelyn Innes'
again," I said, "because it is in this very book
that he is said to have painted so many of his
friends. Ulick Dean is undoubtedly Yeats. It
has been suggested that Arnold Dolmetsch posed
for the portrait of Evelyn's father. Dolmetsch's
testimony on this point goes farther. He says
that he dictated certain passages in the
book...."</p>

<p>"What is it, then? What is the difference?
There is some difference, of that I am sure...."</p>

<p>"The difference is&mdash;" I began when the door
opened and Marcel entered, the most amazingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
comprehensive smile on his countenance. "<i>Mademoiselle
vous attend</i>," he said, and he looked the
question. "Shall I bring her in here?"</p>

<p>Sitgreaves answered it immediately, "<i>Je viens</i>."
And then to me, "Wait," as he vanished through
the doorway.... I walked to the window, drew
aside the red curtains, and looked out into the
fountain-splashed court below....</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"What is the difference?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is that you prefer the new Moore
to the old Moore, the author of the later and better
written books to the author of the earlier ones.
'Evelyn Innes' was many times rewritten.
Moore has said that he could never get it to suit
him, but he has also said, recently, that he would
never rewrite another book (a resolution he has
not kept). 'Memoirs of My Dead Life' and
'Hail and Farewell' do not need rewriting.
They are written to stand. 'The Brook Kerith,'
perhaps, you will find equally to your taste. It
will be the newest Moore...."</p>

<p>"You have explained to me," said Sitgreaves,
"the difference: it is one of development. Now
that I think of it I don't believe that Anatole
France could write 'The Brook Kerith.'... It
would be too symbolical, too cynical, in his hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Moore will perhaps make it more human, by knowing
the characters. I wonder," he continued musingly,
as we left the room, and descended the
stairs, "if he told you whether that hair on
Paul's chest was red or black...."</p>

<h3>The Authoritative Work on<br />
American Music</h3>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="The_Authoritative_Work" id="The_Authoritative_Work"></a>The Authoritative Work<br />
on American Music</h2>


<p>H. L. Mencken pointed out to me recently,
in his most earnest and persuasive
manner, that it was my duty to
write a book about the American composers, exposing
their futile pretensions and describing their
flaccid <i>opera</i>, stave by stave. It was in vain that
I urged that this would be but a sleeveless errand,
arguing that I could not fight men of straw, that
these our composers had no real standing in the
concert halls, and that pushing them over would be
an easy exercise for a child of ten. On the contrary,
he retorted, they belonged to the academies;
certain people believed that they were important;
it was necessary to dislodge this belief.
I suggested, with a not too heavily assumed humility,
that I had already done something of the
sort in an essay entitled "The Great American
Composer." "A good beginning," asserted Col.
Mencken, "but not long enough. I won't be satisfied
with anything less than a book." "But if I
wrote a book about Professors Parker, Chadwick,
Hadley, and the others I could find nothing different
to say about them; they are all alike. Neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
their lives nor their music offer opportunities for
variations." "An excellent idea!" cried Major
Mencken, enthusiastically, "Write one chapter
and then repeat it verbatim throughout the book,
changing only the name of the principal character.
Then clap on a preface, explaining your reason
for this procedure." My last protest was the
feeblest of all: "I can't spend a year or a
month or a week poring over the scores of these
fellows; I can't go to concerts to hear their music.
I might as well go to work in a coal mine." "I'll
do it for you!" triumphantly checkmated General
Mencken. "I'll read the scores and you shall
write the book!" And so he left me, as on a
similar occasion the fiend, having exhibited his
prospectus, vanished from the eyes of our Lord.
And I returned to my home sorely troubled, finding
that the words of the man were running about in
my head like so many little Japanese waltzing
mice.</p>

<p>And, after much cogitation, I went to such and
such a book case and took down a certain volume
written by Louis Charles Elson (a very large red
tome) and another by Rupert Hughes, to see if
their words of praise for our weak musical brothers
would stir me to action. I found that they did
not. My heart action remained normal; no film<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
covered my eyes; foam did not issue from my
mouth. Indeed I read, quite calmly, in Mr.
Hughes's "American Composers" that A. J.
Goodrich is "recognized among scholars abroad as
one of the leading spirits of our time"; that
"(Henry Holden) Huss has ransacked the piano
and pillaged almost every imaginable fabric of
high colour.... The result is gorgeous and purple";
that "The thing we are all waiting for is
that American grand opera, <i>The Woman of
Marblehead</i> (by Louis Adolphe Coerne). It is
predicted that it will not receive the marble
heart"; that "I know of no modern composer who
has come nearer to relighting the fires that burn
in the old gavottes and fugues and preludes (than
Arthur Foote). His two gavottes are to me away
the best since Bach"; that "the song (<i>Israfel</i> by
Edgar Stillman-Kelley) is in my fervent belief, a
masterwork of absolute genius, one of the very
greatest lyrics in the world's music"; and in "The
History of American Music" by Louis C. Elson
that "Music has made even more rapid strides
than literature among us," and that "he (George
W. Chadwick) has reconciled the symmetrical
(sonata) form with modern passion." But it
was in the fourth volume of "The Art of Music,"
published by the National Society of Music, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
I found the supreme examples of this kind of
writing. The volume was edited by Arthur Farwell
and W. Dermot Darby. Therein I read with
a sort of awed astonishment that one of the songs
of Frederick Ayres "reveals a poignancy of imagination
and a perception and apprehension of
beauty seldom attained by any composer." I
learned that T. Carl Whitmer has a "spiritual
kinship" with Arthur Shepherd, Hans Pfitzner,
and Vincent d'Indy. His music is "psychologically
subtle and spiritually rarefied: in colour
it corresponds to the violet end of the spectrum."
I turned the pages until I came to the name of
Miss Gena Branscombe: "Inexhaustible buoyancy,
a superlative emotional wealth, and wholly
singular gift of musical intuition are the qualities
which have shaped the composer's musical personality
(without much effort of the imagination we
might say that they are the qualities that shaped
Beethoven's musical personality).... Her impatient
melodies leap and dash with youthful life,
while her accompaniments abound in harmonic
hairbreadth escapes." Before he became acquainted
with the later French idiom Harvey W.
Loomis "spontaneously breathed forth the quality
of spirit which we now recognize in a Debussy or a
Ravel."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Curiously enough, however, these statements did
not annoy me. I found no desire arising in me to
deny them and doubtless, though mayhap with a
guilty conscience, I should have ditched the undertaking,
consigned it to that heap of undone
duties, where already lie notes on a comparison of
Andalusian mules with the mules of Liane de
Pougy, a few scribbled memoranda for a treatise
on the love habits of the mole, and a half-finished
biography of the talented gentleman who signed
his works, "Nick Carter," if my by this time quite
roving eye had not alighted, entirely fortuitously,
on one of the forgotten glories of my library, a
slender volume entitled "Popular American Composers."</p>

<p>I recalled how I had bought this book. Happening
into a modest second-hand bookshop on
lower Third Avenue, maintained chiefly for the
laudable purpose of redistributing paper novels
of the Seaside and kindred libraries, of which, alas,
we hear very little nowadays, I asked the proprietor
if by chance he possessed any literature relating
to the art of music. By way of answer, he
retired to the very back of his little room, searched
for a space in a litter on the floor, and then returned
with a pile of nine volumes or so in his
arms. The titles, such as "Great Violinists,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
"Harmony in Thirteen Lessons," and "How to
Sing," did not intrigue me, but in idly turning the
pages of this "Popular American Composers" I
came across a half-tone reproduction of a photograph
of Paul Dresser, the only less celebrated
brother of Theodore Dreiser, with a short biography
of the composer of <i>On the Banks of the
Wabash</i>. As Sir George Grove in his excellent
dictionary neglected to mention this portentous
name in American Art and Letters (although he
devoted sixty-seven pages, printed in double columns,
to Mendelssohn) I saw the advantage of adding
the little book to my collection. The bookseller,
when questioned, offered to relinquish the
volume for a total of fifteen cents, and I carried
it away with me. Once I had become more thoroughly
acquainted with its pages I realized that I
would willingly have paid fifteen dollars for it.</p>

<p>This book, indeed, cannot fail to delight General
Mencken. There is no reference in its pages
to Edgar Stillman-Kelley, Miss Gena Branscombe,
Louis Adolphe Coerne, Henry Holden
Huss, T. Carl Whitmer, Arthur Farwell, Arthur
Foote, or A. J. Goodrich. In fact, if we overlook
brief notices of John Philip Sousa, Harry
von Tilzer, Paul Dresser, Charles K. Harris, and
Hattie Starr (whom you will immediately recall as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the composer of <i>Little Alabama Coon</i>), the author,
Frank L. Boyden, has not hesitated to go to the
roots of his subject, pushing aside the college professors
and their dictums, and has turned his attention
to figures in the art life of America, from
whom, Mencken himself, I feel sure, would not take
a single paragraph of praise, so richly is it deserved.
I am unfamiliar with the causes contributing
to this book's comparative obscurity;
perhaps, indeed, they are similar to those responsible
for the early failure of "Sister Carrie."
May not we even suspect that the odium cast by
the Doubledays on the author of that romance
might have been actively transferred in some
degree to a work which contained a biographical
notice and a picture of his brother? At any rate,
"Popular American Composers," published in
1902, fell into undeserved oblivion and so I make
no apology for inviting my readers to peruse its
pages with me.</p>

<p>Opening the book, then, at random, I discover on
page 96 a biography of Lottie A. Kellow (her
photograph graces the reverse of this page). In
a few well-chosen words (almost indeed in "gipsy
phrases") Mr. Boyden gives us the salient details
of her career. Mrs. Kellow is a resident of
Cresco, Iowa, a church singer of note, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
possessor of a contralto voice of great volume.
As a composer she has to her credit "marches,
cakewalks, schottisches, and other styles of instrumental
music." We are given a picture of Mrs.
Kellow at work: "Mrs. Kellow's best efforts are
made in the evening, and in darkness, save the
light of the moonbeams on the keys of her piano."
We are also told that "she is happy in her inspirations
and a sincere lover of music. All of
her compositions show a decided talent and possess
musical elements which are only to be found in
the works of an artist. Mrs. Kellow's musical
friends are confident of her success as a composer
and predict for her a brilliant future."</p>

<p>Let us turn to the somewhat more extensive
biography of W. T. Mullin on Page 4 (his photograph
faces this page). Almost in the first
line the author rewards our attention: "To him
may be applied the simplest and grandest eulogy
Shakespeare ever pronounced: 'He was a man.'"
We are also informed that he was born of a cultured
family, that his inherited nobility of character
has been carefully fostered by a thorough
education, and told that one finds in him the unusual
combination of genius wedded to sound common
sense and practical business capacity. His
family moved to Colorado, Texas, while he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
still a lad and here his musical talent began to
display itself. "The inventive faculties of the
small boy, and the innate harmony of the musician,
combined to improvise a crude instrument
which emitted the notes of the scale. Successful
at drawing forth a concord of sweet sounds,
he continued to experiment upon everything
which would emit musical vibrations. (Even
the pigs, I take it, did not escape.) He
consequently discovered the laws of vibrating
chords before he had mastered the intricacies of
the multiplication table. Yet strange as it may
seem, his musical education was neglected. A four
months' course in piano instruction was interrupted
and then resumed for two months more.
Upon this meagre foundation rested his subsequent
phenomenal progress." I pause to point
out to the astonished and breathless reader that
even Mozart and Schubert, infant prodigies that
they were, received more training than this.</p>

<p>I continue to quote: "At the age of thirteen
he joined The Colorado (Texas) Cornet Band as
a charter member. The youngest member of the
band, he soon outstripped his comrades by virtue
of his superior natural ability. His position was
that of second tenor. Wearying of the monotony
of playing, he determined to venture on solo work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
The boy felt the impetus of restless power and
the following incident illustrates his remarkable
originality. Taking the piano score of a favourite
melody he transposed it within the compass of
the second tenor. This feat evoked admiring applause
because of his extreme youth and untrained
abilities. The band-master remarked that elderly
and experienced heads could hardly have accomplished
this.</p>

<p>"From boyhood to manhood he has remained
with the Colorado (Texas) band as one of its most
efficient members, composing in his leisure moments,
marches, ragtimes, waltzes, song and dance schottisches,
etc. Of his many meritorious compositions
only one has so far been given to the public:&mdash;<i>The
West Texas Fair March</i>, composed for
and dedicated to the management of the West
Texas Fair and Round-up. This institution holds
its annual meetings at Abilene, Texas. There the
march was played for the first time at their October,
1899, meet with great success, and again
at their September, 1900, meet by the Stockman
band of Colorado, Texas, which has furnished
music for the West Texas Fair during their 1899
and 1900 meetings. Mr. Mullin's position in the
Stockman band is that of euphonium soloist. He
is a proficient performer upon all band instruments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
from cornet to tuba, including slide trombone,
his favourites being the baritone and the
trombone.</p>

<p>"He plays many stringed instruments, as well
as the piano and organ. He is the proud possessor
of a genuine Stradivarius violin&mdash;a family
heirloom&mdash;which he naturally prizes beyond the
intrinsic value. The feat of playing on several
instruments at once presents no difficulty to him.</p>

<p>"This briefly sketches Mr. Mullin's life, character
and ability as a musician. His accompanying
photograph reveals his superb physique. Personally
he possesses charming, agreeable manners
and Chesterfieldan courteousness, which vastly
contributes to his popularity. Sincere devotion
to his art has been rewarded by that elevating
nobility of soul, which alone can penetrate the blue
expanse of space and revel in the music of the
spheres."</p>

<p>What more is there to say? I can only assure
the reader that Mullin stands unique among all
musicians, creative and interpretative, in being
able to play the organ, many stringed instruments,
and all the instruments in a brass band (several of
them simultaneously; it would be interesting to
know which and how) after studying the piano for
six months. I sincerely hope that the mistake he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
made in withholding all his compositions, save one,
from the public, has been rectified.</p>

<p>Helen Kelsey Fox, like so many of our talented
men and women, has a European strain in her
blood. She is a lineal descendant on her mother's
side of a French nobleman and a German princess.
Nevertheless she continues to reside in Vermilion,
Ohio. She is of a "decided poetic nature and
lives in an atmosphere of her own. She dwells in
a world of thought peopled by the creations of an
active and lyric mentality." She is so imbued
with the poetic spark that, as she expresses it, she
"speaks in rhyme half the time."</p>

<p>John Z. Macdonald, strictly speaking, is not
an American composer. He was born in Scotland
and came to America in 1881 at the age of 21, but
as he is one of the very few composers since Nero
to enter public political life he well deserves a place
in this collection. In 1890 he was elected city
clerk of Brazil, Indiana, a position which he held
for seven years. In 1898 he was elected treasurer
of Clay County, Indiana. This county is democratic
"by between five and six hundred" but Mr.
Macdonald was elected on the republican ticket
by a majority of 133. He was the only republican
elected. Among the best known of Mr. Macdonald's
compositions is his famous "expansion"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
song, in which he predicted the fate of Aguinaldo.
He has autograph letters, praising this song, from
the late President McKinley, Col. Roosevelt, General
Harrison, Admiral Schley, John Philip Sousa
and other "eminent gentlemen."</p>

<p>Edward Dyer, born in Washington, was the son
of a marble cutter who "helped to erect the
U. S. Treasury, Patent Office, and Capitol....
In the majority of his compositions there is a
tinge of sadness which appeals to his auditors....
Mr. Dyer never descends to coarseness or
vulgarity in his productions; he writes pure, clean
words, something that can be sung in the home,
school and on the stage to refined respectable people."</p>

<p>We learn much of the study years of Mrs. Lucy
L. Taggart: "From earliest childhood she received
valuable musical instruction from her
father (Mr. Longsdon) who, coming from England
in 1835, purchased the first piano that came to
Chicago, an elegant hand-carved instrument that
is still treasured in the old home." Later "she
studied under Prof. C. E. Brown, of Owego, N. Y.,
Prof. Heimburger, of San Francisco and Herr
Chas. Goffrie. Mrs. Taggart was also for five
years a pupil of Senor Arevalo, the famous guitar
soloist of Los Angeles.... Mrs. Taggart has in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
preparation (1902) <i>Methought He Touched the
Strings</i>, an idyl for piano in memory of the late
Senor M. S. Arevalo."</p>

<p>David Weidley, born in Philadelphia, is the composer
of the following songs, <i>Old Spooney Spooppalay</i>,
<i>Jennie Ree</i>, <i>Autumn Leaves</i>, <i>Hannah Glue</i>,
and <i>Uncle Reuben and Aunt Lucinda</i>. "He has
done much to create and elevate a taste for music
in the community where he resides and where he is
known as 'Dave.' Even the little children call
him 'Dave' as freely and innocently as those who
have known him for years, and there can be no
greater compliment for any man than that he is
known and loved by the children. Mr. Weidley is
by profession a sheet metal worker. He is a P. G.
of the I. O. O. F., and a P. C. in the Knights of
Pythias. He is not identified with any church, but
loves and serves his fellow-men."</p>

<p>In the biography of Delmer G. Palmer we are
assured that "Versatility is a trait with which
musical composers are not excessively burdened.
There are few performers who can include <i>The
Moonlight Sonata</i> and Schubert's <i>Serenade</i> with
selections from <i>The Merry-go-round</i>, and do justice
to the expression of each, much less would
such adaptability be looked for among composers.
As most rules have exceptions, in this there is one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
who stands in a class occupied by no one else, Mr.
Delmer G. Palmer, the 'Green Mountain Composer,'
who at present resides in Kansas City.</p>

<p>"As recently as 1899 Mr. Palmer wrote a song
in the popular 'ragtime,' <i>My Sweetheart is a Midnight
Coon</i> and almost in the same breath also
wrote the heavy sacred solo, <i>Christ in Gethsemane</i>.
The first is of the usual light order characteristic
of this class of music. The latter is as far removed
to the contrary as is comedy from tragedy.
The 'coon' song entered the bubbling effervescing
cauldron of what is termed 'ragtime' music
among the multitudinous others, and soon was seen
peeping through at the surface among the lightest
and most catchy.... The sacred solo found its
level among the heavier in its class, and if the term
may be here applied, it was also a hit."</p>

<p>S. Duncan Baker, born August 25, 1855, still
lives (1902) in the old family residence at Natchez,
Miss. "In this house is located the den
where he has spent many hours with his collection
of banjos and pictures and in writing for and
playing on the instrument which he adopted as a
favourite during its dark days (about 1871)."
We are told that he composed an "artistic banjo
solo," entitled, <i>Memories of Farland</i>. "Had this
production or its companion piece, <i>Thoughts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the Cadenza</i>, been written by an old master for
some other instrument and later have been adapted
by a modern composer to the banjo, either or both
of them would have been pronounced classic, barring
some slight defects in form."</p>

<p>I cannot stop to quote from the delightful accounts
offered us of the lives and works of Albert
Matson, George D. Tufts, D. O. Loy, Lavinia
Pascoe Oblad, and forty or fifty other American
singers, but it seems to me that I have done
enough, Mencken, to prove to you that the great
book on American music has been written. Without
one single mention of the names of Horatio
Parker, George W. Chadwick, Frederick Converse,
or Henry Hadley, by a transference of the emphasis
to the place where it belongs, the author
of this undying book has answered your prayer.</p>

<h2><a name="Old_Days_and_New" id="Old_Days_and_New"></a>Old Days and New</h2>


<p>Some toothless old sentimentalist or other
periodically sets up a melancholy howl for
"the good old days of comic opera," whatever
or whenever they were. Perhaps none of us,
once past forty, is guiltless in this respect. Nothing,
not even the smell of an apple-blossom from
the old homestead, the sight of a daguerreotype of
a miss one kissed at the age of ten, or a taste of a
piece of the kind of pie that "mother used to
make" so arouses the sensibility of a man of middle
age as the memory of some musical show which
he saw in his budding manhood. That is why revivals
of these venerable institutions are frequently
projected and, some of them, very successfully
accomplished. When a manager revives
an old drama he must appeal to the interest of his
audience; it may not be the identical interest which
held the original spectators of the piece spell-bound,
but, none the less, it must be an interest.
When a manager revives an old musical comedy he
appeals directly to sentiment.</p>

<p>Of course, the exact date of the good old days
is a variable quantity. I have known a vain regretter
to turn no further back than to the nights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of <i>The Merry Widow</i>, <i>The Waltz Dream</i>, <i>The
Chocolate Soldier</i>, <i>The Girl in the Train</i>, and <i>The
Dollar Princess</i>, in other words to the Viennese
renaissance; another, in using the phrase, is subconsciously
conjuring up pictures of <i>La Belle
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i>, <i>Orph&eacute;e aux Enfers</i>, or <i>La Fille de Madame
Angot</i>, good fodder for memory to feed on here;
a third will instinctively revert to the Johann
Strauss operetta period, the era of <i>The Queen's
Lace Handkerchief</i> and <i>Die Fledermaus</i>; a fourth
cries, "Give us Gilbert and Sullivan!" A fifth,
when his ideas are chased to their lair, will rhapsodize
endlessly over the charms of the London
Gaiety when <i>The Geisha</i>, <i>The Country Girl</i>, and
<i>The Circus Girl</i> were in favour; a sixth, it seems,
finds his pleasure in Americana, <i>Robin Hood</i>,
<i>Wang</i>, <i>The Babes in Toyland</i>, and <i>El Capitan</i>;
a seventh becomes maudlin to the most
utter degree when you mention <i>Les Cloches de
Corneville</i>, or <i>La Mascotte</i>, products of a decadent
stage in the history of French op&eacute;ra-bouffe. Not
long ago I heard a man speak of the cadet operas
in Boston (did a man named Barnet write them?)
as the last of the great musical pieces; and every
one of you who reads this essay will have a
brother, or a son, or a friend who went to see
<i>Sybil</i> forty-three times and <i>The Girl from Utah</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
seventy-six. Twenty years from now, as he sits
before the open fire, the mere mention of <i>They
Wouldn't Believe Me</i> will cause the tears to course
down his cheeks as he pats the pate of his infant
son or daughter and weepingly describes the never-to-be-forgotten
fascination of Julia Sanderson, the
(in the then days) unattainable agility of Donald
Brian.</p>

<p>In no other form of theatrical entertainment is
the appeal to softness so direct. The man who
attends a performance of a musical farce goes in a
good mood, usually with a couple of friends, or
possibly with <i>the</i> girl. If he has dined well and
his digestion is in working order and he is young
enough, the spell of the lights and the music is
irresistible to his receptive and impressionable
nature. There are those young men, of course,
who are constant attendants because of the altogether
too wonderful hair of the third girl from
the right in the front row. Others succumb to the
dental perfection of the prima donna or to the
shapely legs of the soubrette. All of us, I am
almost proud to admit, at some time or other, are
subject to the contagion. I well remember the
year in which I considered myself as a possible
suitor for the hand of Della Fox. Photographs
and posters of this deity adorned my walls. I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
an assiduous collector of newspaper clippings referring
to her profoundly interesting activities, although
my sophistication had not reached the
stage where I might appeal to Romeike for assistance.
The mere mention of Miss Fox's name
was sufficient cause to make me blush profusely.
Eventually my father was forced to take steps in
the matter when I began, in a valiant effort to
summon up the spirit of the lady's presence, to disturb
the early morning air with vocal assaults on
<i>She Was a Daisy</i>, which, you will surely remember,
was the musical gem of <i>The Little Trooper</i>.
Here are the words of the refrain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She was a daisy, daisy, daisy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driving me crazy, crazy, crazy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helen of Troy and Venus were to her cross-eyed crones!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was dimpled and rosy, rosy, rosy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet as a posy, posy, posy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I doted upon her, my Ann Jane Jones!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You will admit, I think, at first glance, the
superior literary quality of these lines; you will
perceive at once to what immeasurably higher class
of art they belong than the lyrics that librettists
forge for us today.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Wall Street broker, poet, green grocer, soldier,
banker, lawyer, whatever you are, confess the facts
to yourself: you were once as I. You have suffered
the same feelings that I suffered. Perhaps
with you it was not Della Fox.... Who then?
Did saucy Marie Jansen awaken your admiration?
Was pert Lulu Glaser the object of your secret
but persistent attention? How many times did
you go to see Marie Tempest in <i>The Fencing Master</i>,
or Alice Nielsen in <i>The Serenade</i>? Was Virginia
Earle in <i>The Circus Girl</i> the idol of your
youth or was it Mabel Barrison in <i>The Babes in

<i>The Lady Slavey</i>, Hilda Hollins in <i>The Magic

Pretty Maiden</i>, or <i>A Simple Little String</i>, or
<i>J'aime les Militaires</i> (if you whistle this, ten to
one your next door neighbour thinks you have been
to an orchestra concert and heard Beethoven's
<i>Seventh Symphony</i>), or <i>Sister Mary Jane's Top<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Note</i>, or <i>A Wandering Minstrel I</i>, or <i>See How It
Sparkles</i>, or the <i>Lullaby</i> from <i>Erminie</i>, which Pauline
Hall used to sing as if she herself
were asleep, and which Emma Abbott interpolated
in <i>The Mikado</i>, or <i>A Pretty Girl,
A Summer Night</i>, or the <i>Policeman's Chorus</i>
from <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>, or <i>The Soldiers in

Angot</i>, or <i>My Alamo Love</i>?</p>

<p>There is a very subtle and fragrant charm about
these old recollections which the sight or sound of a
score, a view of an old photograph of Lillian Russell
or Judic, or a dip in the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Complet</i> of
Meilhac and Hal&eacute;vy will reawaken. But it is
only at a revival of one of our old favourites that
we can really bathe in sentimentality, drink in
draughts of joy from the past, allow memory full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
away. You whose hair is turning white will be in
Row A, Seat No. 1 for the first performance of a
revival of <i>Robin Hood</i>. You will not hear Edwin
Hoff in his original r&ocirc;le; Jessie Bartlett Davis is
dead and, alas, Henry Clay Barnabee is no longer
on the boards, but the newcomers, possibly, are respectable
substitutes and the airs and lines remain.
You can walk about in the lobby and say proudly
that you attended the <i>first</i> performance of the
opera ever so long ago when operettas had tune
and reason. "Yes sir, there were plots in those
days, and composers, and the singers could <i>act</i>.
Times have certainly changed, sir. Come to the
corner and have a Manhattan.... There were
no cocktails in those days.... There is no singer
like Mrs. Davis today!"</p>

<p>Well the poor souls who cannot feel tenderly
about a past they have not yet experienced have
their recompenses. For one thing I am certain
that the revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas to which De Wolf Hopper devoted his
best talents were better, in many respects, than
the original London productions; just as I am
equally certain that the representations of <i>Aida</i>
at the Metropolitan Opera House are way ahead
of the original performance of that work given
at Cairo before the Khedive of Egypt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there is the musical revue, a form which
we have borrowed from the French, but which
we have vastly improved upon and into which
we have poured some of our most national feeling
and expression. The interpretation of these
frivolities is a new art. Gaby Deslys may be
only half a loaf compared to Marie Jansen, but
I am sure that Elsie Janis is more than three-quarters.
Frank Tinney and Al Jolson can, in
their humble way, efface memories of Digby Bell
and Dan Daly. Adele Rowland and Marie
Dressler have their points (and curves). Irving
Berlin, Louis A. Hirsch, and Jerome Kern are
not to be sniffed at. Neither is P. G. Wodehouse.
Harry B. Smith we have always with us: he is
the Sarah Bernhardt of librettists.</p>

<p>Joseph Urban has wrought a revolution in
stage settings for this form of entertainment.
Louis Sherwin has offered us convincing evidence
to support his theory that the new staging in
America is coming to us by way of the revue and
not through the serious drama. Melville Ellis,
Lady Duff-Gordon, and Paul Poiret have done
their bit for the dresses. In fact, my dear young
man&mdash;who are reading this article&mdash;you will
feel just as tenderly in twenty years about the
<i>Follies of 1917</i> as your father does now about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
<i>Wang</i>. Only, and this is a very big ONLY, the
<i>Follies of 1917</i>, depending as it does entirely on
topical subjects and dimpled knees, cannot be
revived. Fervid and enlivening as its immediate
impression may be it cannot be lasting. You
can never recapture the thrills of this summer by
sitting in Row A, Seat No. 1 at any 1937 <i>reprise</i>.
There can never be anything of the sort. The
revue, like the firefly, is for a night only. We
take it in with the daily papers ... and the next
season, already old-fashioned, it goes forth to
show Grinnell and Davenport how Mlle. Manhattan
deported herself the year before.</p>

<p>So if the youth of these days chooses to be sentimental
in the years to come over the good old
days of Urban scenery and Olive Thomas, the Balloon
Girls of the Midnight Frolic and the chorus of
the Winter Garden, he will be obliged to give way
to the mood at home in front of the fire, see the pictures
in the smoke, and hear the tunes in the dropping
of the coals. Which is perhaps as it should
be. For in 1937 the youth of that epoch can sit
in Row A, Seat No. 1 himself and not be ousted
from his place by a sentimental gentleman of middle
age who longs to hear <i>Poor Butterfly</i> again.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>"Gautier had a theory to the effect that to be a

matter of predestination. 'There is no need to do
anything,' he would say, 'and so far as the writing of

born an Academician as he is born a bishop or a
cook. He can abuse the Academy in a dozen pamphlets
if it amuses him, and be elected all the same;
but if he is not predestined, three hundred volumes
and ten masterpieces, recognized as such by the genuflections

<h2><a name="Two_Young_American_Playwrights" id="Two_Young_American_Playwrights"></a>Two Young American Playwrights</h2>


<p>In the newspaper reports relating to the death
of Auguste Rodin I read with some astonishment
that if the venerable sculptor, who lacked
three years of being eighty when he died, had lived
two weeks longer he would have been admitted to
the French Academy! In other words, the greatest
stone-poet since Michael Angelo, internationally
famous and powerful, the most striking artist
figure, indeed, of the last half century, was to be
permitted, in the extremity of old age, to inscribe
his name on a scroll, which bore the signatures of
many inoffensive nobodies. I could not have been
more amused if the newspapers, in publishing the
obituary notices of John Jacob Astor, had announced
that if the millionaire had not perished
in the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, his chances of being
invited to join the Elks were good; or if "Variety"
or some other tradespaper of the music
halls, had proclaimed, just before Sarah Bernhardt's
d&eacute;but at the Palace Theatre, that if her
appearances there were successful she might expect
an invitation to membership in the White Rats....
These hypothetical instances would seem
ridiculous ... but they are not. The Rodin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
case puts a by no means seldom-recurring phenomenon
in the centre of the stage under a calcium
light. The ironclad dreadnaughts of the academic
world, the reactionary artists, the dry-as-dust
lecturers are constantly ignoring the most
vital, the most real, the most important artists
while they sing polyphonic, antiphonal, Palestrinian
motets in praise of men who have learned to
imitate comfortably and efficiently the work of
their predecessors.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>If there are other contemporary French sculptors
than Rodin their names elude me at the
moment; yet I have no doubt that some ten or
fifteen of these hackmen have their names emblazoned
in the books of all the so-called "honour"
societies in Paris. It is a comfort, on the whole,
to realize that America is not the only country
in which such things happen. As a matter of fact,
they happen nowhere more often than in France.</p>

<p>If some one should ask you suddenly for a list
of the important playwrights of France today,
what names would you let roll off your tongue,
primed by the best punditic and docile French
critics? Henry Bataille, Paul Hervieu, and
Henry Bernstein. Possibly Rostand. Don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
deny this; you know it is true, unless it happens
you have been doing some thinking for yourself.
For even in the works of Remy de Gourmont (to
be sure this very clairvoyant mind did not often
occupy itself with dramatic literature) you will
find little or nothing relating to Octave Mirbeau
and Georges Feydeau. True, Mirbeau did not do
his best work in the theatre. That stinging, cynical
attack on the courts of Justice (?) of France
(nay, the world!), "Le Jardin de Supplice" is
not a play and it is probably Mirbeau's masterpiece
and the best piece of critical fiction written in
France (or anywhere else) in the last fifty years.
However Mirbeau shook the pillars of society even
in the playhouse. <i>Le Foyer</i> was hissed repeatedly
at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais. Night after night the
proceedings ended in the ejection and arrest of
forty or fifty spectators. Even to a mere outsider,
an idle bystander of the boulevards, this
complete exposure of the social, moral, and political
hypocricies of a nation seemed exceptionally
brutal. <i>Le Foyer</i> and "Le Jardin" could only
have been written by a man passionately devoted
to the human ideal ("each as she may," as Gertrude
Stein so beautifully puts it). <i>Les Affaires
sont les Affaires</i> is pure theatre, perhaps, but it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
might be considered the best play produced in
France between Becque's <i>La Parisienne</i> and
Brieux's <i>Les Hannetons</i>.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, on the whole, to find the
critical tribe turning for relief from this somewhat
unpleasant display of Gallic closet skeletons
to the discreet exhibition of a few carefully chosen
bones in the plays of Bernstein and Bataille, direct
descendants of Scribe, Sardou, <i>et Cie</i>, but I may
be permitted to indulge in a slight snicker of polite
amazement when I discover these gentlemen applying
their fingers to their noses in no very pretty-meaning
gesture, directed at a grandson of
Moli&egrave;re. For such is Georges Feydeau. His
method is not that of the Seventeenth Century master,
nor yet that of Mirbeau; nevertheless, aside
from these two figures, Beaumarchais, Marivaux,
Becque, Brieux at his best, and Maurice Donnay
occasionally, there has not been a single writer in
the history of the French theatre so inevitably <i>au
courant</i> with human nature. His form is frankly
farcical and his plays are so funny, so enjoyable
merely as <i>good shows</i> that it seems a pity to raise
an obelisk in the playwright's honour, and yet the
fact remains that he understands the political,
social, domestic, amorous, even cloacal conditions
of the French better than any of his contemporaries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
always excepting the aforementioned
Mirbeau. In <i>On Purge B&eacute;b&eacute;</i> he has written
saucy variations on a theme which Rabelais, Boccaccio,
George Moore, and Moli&egrave;re in collaboration
would have found difficult to handle. It is
as successful an experiment in bravado and bravura
as Mr. Henry James's "The Turn of the
Screw." And he has accomplished this feat with
nimbleness, variety, authority, even (granting the
subject) delicacy. Seeing it for the first time you
will be so submerged in gales of uncontrollable
laughter that you will perhaps not recognize at
once how every line reveals character, how every
situation springs from the foibles of human nature.
Indeed in this one-act farce Feydeau, with
about as much trouble as Zeus took in transforming
his godship into the semblance of a swan, has
given you a well-rounded picture of middle-class
life in France with its external and internal implications....
And how he understands the
buoyant French <i>grue</i>, unselfconscious and undismayed
in any situation. I sometimes think that
<i>Occupe-toi d'Am&eacute;lie</i> is the most satisfactory play
I have ever seen; it is certainly the most delightful.
I do not think you can see it in Paris again.
The Nouveaut&eacute;s, where it was presented for over
a year, has been torn down; an English translation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
would be an insult to Feydeau; nor will you
find essays about it in the yellow volumes in which
the French critics tenderly embalm their <i>feuilletons</i>;
nor do I think Arthur Symons or George
Moore, those indefatigable diggers in Parisian
graveyards, have discovered it for their English
readers. Reading the play is to miss half its
pleasure; so you must take my word in the matter
unless you have been lucky enough to see it yourself,
in which case ten to one you will agree with
me that one such play is worth a kettleful of
boiled-over drama like <i>Le Voleur</i>, <i>Le Secret</i>, <i>Samson</i>,
<i>La Vierge Folle</i>, <i>et cetera</i>, <i>et cetera</i>. In the
pieces I have mentioned Feydeau, in representation,
had the priceless assistance of a great comic
artist, Armande Cassive. If we are to take Mr.
Symons's assurance in regard to de Pachmann
that he is the world's greatest pianist because he
does one thing more perfectly than any one else,
by a train of similar reasoning we might confidently
assert that Mlle. Cassive is the world's
greatest actress.</p>

<p>When you ask a Frenchman to explain why he
does not like Mirbeau (and you will find that
Frenchmen invariably do not like him) he will
shrug his shoulders and begin to tell you that Mirbeau
was not good to his mother, or that he drank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
to excess, or that he did not wear a red, white, and
blue coat on the Fourteenth of July, or that he
did not stand for the French spirit as exemplified
in the eating of snails on Christmas. In other
words, he will immediately place himself in a position
in which you may be excused for regarding
him as a person whose opinion is worth nothing,
whereas his ratiocinatory powers on subjects with
which he is more in sympathy may be excellent. I
know why he does not like Mirbeau. Mirbeau is
the reason. In his life he was not accustomed to
making compromises nor was he accustomed to
making friends (which comes after all to the same
thing). He did what he pleased, said what he
pleased, wrote what he pleased. His armorial
bearings might have been a cat upsetting a cream
jug with the motto, "<i>Je m'en fous</i>." The author
of "Le Jardin de Supplice" would not be in high
favour anywhere; nevertheless I would willingly
relinquish any claims I might have to future popularity
for the privilege of having been permitted
to sign this book.</p>

<p>Feydeau is distinctly another story; his plays
are more successful than any others given in Paris.
They are so amusing that even while he is pointing
the finger at your own particular method of living
you are laughing so hard that you haven't time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
to see the application.... So the French critics
have set him down as another popular figure, only
a nobody born to entertain the boulevards, just
as the American critics regard the performances
of Irving Berlin with a steely supercilious impervious
eye. The Viennese scorned Mozart because
he entertained them. "A gay population," wrote
the late John F. Runciman, "always a heartless
master, holds none in such contempt as the servants
who provide it with amusement."</p>

<p>The same condition has prevailed in England
until recently. A few seasons ago you might have
found the critics pouring out their glad songs
about Arthur Wing Pinero and Henry Arthur
Jones. Bernard Shaw has, in a measure, restored
the balance to the British theatre. He is not only
a brilliant playwright; he is a brilliant critic as
well. Foreseeing the fate of the under man in
such a struggle he became his own literary huckster
and by outcriticizing the other critics he easily
established himself as the first English (or Irish)
playwright. When he thus rose to the top, by
dint of his own exertions, he had strength enough
to carry along with him a number of other important
authors. As a consequence we may regard
the Pinero incident closed and in ten years
his theatre will be considered as old-fashioned and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
as inadept as that of Robertson or Bulwer-Lytton.</p>

<p>Having no Shaw in America, no man who can
write brilliant prefaces and essays about his own
plays until the man in the street is obliged perforce
to regard them as literature, we find ourselves
in the condition of benighted France. Dulness
is mistaken for literary flavour; the injection
of a little learning, of a little poetry (so-called)
into a theatrical hackpiece, is the signal for a good
deal of enthusiasm on the part of the journalists
(there are two brilliant exceptions). Which of
our playwrights are taken seriously by the pundits?
Augustus Thomas and Percy MacKaye:
Thomas the dean, and MacKaye the poet laureate.
I have no intention of wrenching the laurel
wreathes from these august brows. Let them remain.
Each of these gentlemen has a long and
honourable career in the theatre behind him, from
which he should be allowed to reap what financial
and honourary rewards he may be able. But I
would not add one leaf to these wreathes, nor one
crotchet to the songs of praise which vibrate
around them. I turn aside from their plays in
the theatre and in the library as I turn aside from
the fictions of Pierre de Coulevain and Arnold Bennett.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>I love to fashion wreathes of my own and if two
young men will now step forward to the lecturer's
bench I will take delight in crowning them with
my own hands. Will the young man at the back
of the hall please page Avery Hopwood and Philip
Moeller?... No response! They seem to have
retreated modestly into the night. Nevertheless
they shall not escape me!</p>

<p>I speak of Mr. Hopwood first because he has
been writing for our theatre for a longer period
than has Mr. Moeller, and because his position,
such as it is, is assured. Like Feydeau in France
he has a large popular following; he has probably
made more money in a few years than Mr. Thomas
has made during his whole lifetime and the managers
are always after him to furnish them with
more plays with which to fill their theatres. For
his plays do fill the theatres. <i>Fair and Warmer</i>,
<i>Nobody's Widow</i>, <i>Clothes</i>, and <i>Seven Days</i>, would
be included in any list of the successful pieces produced
in New York within the past ten years.
Two of these pieces would be near the very top
of such a list. An utterly absurd allotment of
actors is sufficient to explain the failures of <i>Sadie
Love</i> and <i>Our Little Wife</i> and it might be well if
some one should attempt a revival of one of his
three serious plays, <i>This Woman and This Man</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
in which Carlotta Nillson appeared for a brief
space.</p>

<p>This author, mainly through the beneficent
offices of a gift of supernal charm, contrives to do
in English very much what Feydeau does in French.
It is his contention that you can smite the Puritans,
even in the American theatre, squarely on
the cheek, provided you are sagacious in your
choice of weapon. In <i>Fair and Warmer</i> he provokes
the most boisterous and at the same time the
most innocent laughter with a scene which might
have been made insupportably vulgar. A perfectly
respectable young married woman gets very drunk
with the equally respectable husband of one of
her friends. The scene is the mainstay, the <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i>, of the play, and it furnishes the material
for the better part of one act; yet young and old,
rich and poor, philistine and superman alike, delight
in it. To make such a situation irresistible
and universal in its appeal is, it seems to me, undoubtedly
the work of genius. What might, indeed
should, have been disgusting, was not only in
intention but in performance very funny. Let
those who do not appreciate the virtuosity of this
undertaking attempt to write as successful a scene
in a similar vein. Even if they are able to do so,
and I do not for a moment believe that there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
another dramatic author in America who can, they
will be the first to grant the difficulty of the
achievement. With an apparently inexhaustible
fund of fantasy and wit Mr. Hopwood passes his
wand over certain phases of so-called smart life,
almost always with the happiest results. With a
complete realization of the independence of his
medium he often ignores the realistic conventions
and the traditional technique of the stage, but his
touch is so light and joyous, his wit so free from
pose, that he rarely fails to establish his effect.
His pen has seldom faltered. Occasionally, however,
the heavy hand of an uncomprehending stage
director or of an aggressive actor has played
havoc with the delicate texture of his fabric.
There is no need here for the use of hammer or
trowel; if an actress must seek aid in implements,
let her rather rely on a soft brush, a lacy handkerchief,
or a sparkling spangled fan.</p>

<p>Philip Moeller has achieved distinction in another
field, that of elegant burlesque, of sublimated
caricature. His stage men and women are as
adroitly distorted (the better to expose their
comic possibilities) as the drawings of Max Beerbohm.
Beginning with the Bible and the Odyssey
(<i>Helena's Husband</i> and <i>Sisters of Susannah</i> for
the Washington Square Players) he has at length,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
by way of Shakespeare and Bacon (<i>The Roadhouse
in Arden</i>) arrived at the Romantic Period
in French literature and in <i>Madame Sand</i>, his first
three-act play, he has established himself at once
as a dangerous rival of the authors of <i>C&aelig;sar and
Cleopatra</i> and <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i>,
both plays in the same <i>genre</i> as Mr. Moeller's
latest contribution to the stage. The author has
thrown a very high light on the sentimental adventures
of the writing lady of the early Nineteenth
Century, has indeed advised us and convinced us
that they were somewhat ridiculous. So they must
have appeared even to her contemporaries, however
seriously George took herself, her romances,
her passions, her petty tragedies. A less adult, a
less seriously trained mind might have fallen into
the error of making a sentimental play out of
George's affairs with Alfred de Musset, Dr. Pagello,
and Chopin (Mr. Moeller contents himself
with these three passions, selected from the somewhat
more extensive list offered to us by history).
Such an author would doubtless have written
<i>Great Catherine</i> in the style of <i>Disraeli</i> and <i>Androcles
and the Lion</i> after the manner of <i>Ben Hur</i>!
Whether love itself is always a comic subject, as
Bernard Shaw would have us believe, is a matter
for dispute, but there can be no alternative opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
about the loves of George Sand. A rehearsal of
them offers only laughter to any one but a sentimental
school girl.</p>

<p>The piece is conceived on a true literary level;
it abounds in wit, in fantasy, in delightful situations,
but there is nothing precious about its
progress. Mr. Moeller has carefully avoided the
traps expressly laid for writers of such plays.
For example, the enjoyment of <i>Madame Sand</i> is in
no way dependent upon a knowledge of the books
of that authoress, De Musset, and Heine, nor yet
upon an acquaintance with the music of Liszt and
Chopin. Such matters are pleasantly and lightly
referred to when they seem pertinent, but no insistence
is laid upon them. Occasionally our author
has appropriated some phrase originally
spoken or written by one of the real characters,
but for that he can scarcely be blamed. Indeed,
when one takes into consideration the wealth of
such material which lay in books waiting for him,
it is surprising that he did not take more advantage
of it. In the main he has relied on his
own cleverness to delight our ears for two hours
with brilliant conversation.</p>

<p>There is, it should be noted, in conclusion, nothing
essentially American about either of these
young authors. Both Mr. Hopwood and Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Moeller might have written for the foreign stage.
Several of Mr. Hopwood's pieces, indeed, have already
been transported to foreign climes and there
seems every reason for belief that Mr. Moeller's
comedy will meet a similarly happy fate.</p>

<h2><a name="De_Senectute_Cantorum" id="De_Senectute_Cantorum"></a>De Senectute Cantorum</h2>


<p>"I am not sure," writes Arthur Symons in his
admirable essay on Sarah Bernhardt, "that
the best moment to study an artist is not
the moment of what is called decadence. The
first energy of inspiration is gone; what remains
is the method, the mechanism, and it is that which
alone one can study, as one can study the mechanism
of the body, not the principle of life itself.
What is done mechanically, after the heat of the
blood has cooled, and the divine accidents have
ceased to happen, is precisely all that was consciously
skilful in the performance of an art. To
see all this mechanism left bare, as the form of a
skeleton is left bare when age thins the flesh upon
it is to learn more easily all that is to be learnt of
structure, the art which not art but nature has
hitherto concealed with its merciful covering."</p>

<p>Mr. Symons, of course, had an actress in mind,
but his argument can be applied to singers as well,
although it is safest to remember that much of
the true beauty of the human voice inevitably departs
with the youth of its owner. Still style in
singing is not noticeably affected by age and an
artist who possesses or who has acquired this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
quality very often can afford to make lewd gestures
at Father Time. If good singing depended
upon a full and sensuous tone, such artists as Ronconi,
Victor Maurel, Max Heinrich, Ludwig
W&uuml;llner, and Maurice Renaud would never have
had any careers at all. It is obvious that any
true estimate of their contribution to the lyric
stage would put the chief emphasis on style, and
this is usually the explanation for extended success
on the opera or concert stage, although occasionally
an extraordinary and exceptional singer
may continue to give pleasure to her auditors, despite
the fact that she has left middle age behind
her, by the mere lovely quality of the tone she
produces.</p>

<p>In the history of opera there may be found the
names of many singers who have maintained their
popularity and, indeed, a good deal of their art,
long past fifty, and there is recorded at least one
instance in which a singer, after a long absence
from the theatre, returned to the scene of her
earlier triumphs with her powers unimpaired, even
augmented. I refer, of course, to Henrietta Sontag,
born in 1805, who retired from the stage of
the King's Theatre in London in 1830 in her
twenty-fifth year and who returned twenty years
later in 1849. She had, in the meantime, become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the Countess Rossi, but although she had abandoned
the stage her reappearance proved that she
had not remained idle during her period of retirement.
For she was one of those artists in whom
early "inspiration" counted for little and
"method" for much. She was, indeed, a mistress
of style. She came back to the public in <i>Linda
di Chaminoux</i> and H. F. Chorley ("Thirty Years'
Musical Recollections") tells us that "all went
wondrously well. No magic could restore to her
voice an upper note or two which Time had taken;
but the skill, grace, and precision with which she
turned to account every atom of power she still
possessed,&mdash;the incomparable steadiness with
which she wrought out her composer's intentions&mdash;she
carried through the part, from first to last,
without the slightest failure, or sign of weariness&mdash;seemed
a triumph. She was greeted&mdash;as she
deserved to be&mdash;as a beloved old friend come
home again in the late sunnier days.</p>

<p>"But it was not at the moment of Madame
Sontag's reappearance that we could advert to all
the difficulty which added to the honour of its
success.&mdash;She came back under musical conditions
entirely changed since she left the stage&mdash;to
an orchestra far stronger than that which had
supported her voice when it was younger; and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
a new world of operas.&mdash;Into this she ventured
with an intrepid industry not to be overpraised&mdash;with
every new part enhancing the respect of
every real lover of music.&mdash;During the short period
of these new performances at Her Majesty's
Theatre, which was not equivalent to two complete
Opera seasons, not merely did Madame Sontag
go through the range of her old characters&mdash;Susanna,
Rosina, Desdemona, Donna Anna, and
the like&mdash;but she presented herself in seven or
eight operas which had not existed when she left
the stage&mdash;Bellini's <i>Sonnambula</i>, Donizetti's
<i>Linda</i>, <i>La Figlia del Reggimento</i>, <i>Don Pasquale</i>;
<i>Le Tre Nozze</i>, of Signor Alary, <i>La Tempesta</i>, by
M. Hal&eacute;vy&mdash;the last two works involving what
the French call 'creation,' otherwise the production
of a part never before represented.&mdash;In one
of the favourite characters of her predecessor, the
elder artist beat the younger one hollow.&mdash;This
was as Maria, in Donizetti's <i>La Figlia</i>, which
Mdlle. Lind may be said to have brought to England,
and considered as her special property....
With myself, the real value of Madame Sontag
grew, night after night&mdash;as her variety, her conscientious
steadiness, and her adroit use of diminished
powers were thus mercilessly tested. In one
respect, compared with every one who had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
in my time, she was alone, in right, perhaps of
the studies of her early days&mdash;as a singer of
Mozart's music."</p>

<p>It was after these last London seasons that
Mme. Sontag undertook an American tour. She
died in Mexico.</p>

<p>The great Mme. Pasta's ill-advised return to
the stage in 1850 (when she made two belated appearances
in London) is matter for sadder comment.
Chorley, indeed, is at his best when he
writes of it, his pen dipped in tears, for none had
admired this artist in her prime more passionately
than he. Here was a particularly good opportunity
to study the bare skeleton of interpretative
art; the result is one of the most striking
passages in all literature:</p>

<p>"Her voice, which at its best, had required
ceaseless watching and practice, had been long ago
given up by her. Its state of utter ruin on the
night in question passes description.&mdash;She had
been neglected by those who, at least, should have
presented her person to the best advantage admitted
by Time.&mdash;Her queenly robes (she was to
sing some scenes from <i>Anna Bolena</i>) in nowise
suited or disguised her figure. Her hair-dresser
had done some tremendous thing or other with her
head&mdash;or rather had left everything undone. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
more painful and disastrous spectacle could hardly
be looked on.&mdash;There were artists present, who
had then, for the first time, to derive some impression
of a renowned artist&mdash;perhaps, with the
natural feeling that her reputation had been exaggerated.&mdash;Among
these was Rachel&mdash;whose
bitter ridicule of the entire sad show made itself
heard throughout the whole theatre, and drew attention
to the place where she sat&mdash;one might
even say, sarcastically enjoying the scene.
Among the audience, however, was another gifted
woman, who might far more legitimately have
been shocked at the utter wreck of every musical
means of expression in the singer&mdash;who might
have been more naturally forgiven, if some humour
of self-glorification had made her severely just&mdash;not
worse&mdash;to an old <i>prima donna</i>;&mdash;I mean
Madame Viardot.&mdash;Then, and not till then, she
was hearing Madame Pasta.&mdash;But Truth will always
answer to the appeal of Truth. Dismal as
was the spectacle&mdash;broken, hoarse, and destroyed
as was the voice&mdash;the great style of the singer
spoke to the great singer. The first scene was
Ann Boleyn's duet with Jane Seymour. The old
spirit was heard and seen in Madame Pasta's
<i>Sorgi!</i> and the gesture with which she signed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
her penitent rival to rise. Later, she attempted
the final mad scene of the opera&mdash;that most complicated
and brilliant among the mad scenes on
the modern musical stage&mdash;with its two <i>cantabile</i>
movements, its snatches of recitative, and its <i>bravura</i>
of despair, which may be appealed to as an
example of vocal display, till then unparagoned,
when turned to the account of frenzy, not frivolity&mdash;perhaps
as such commissioned by the superb
creative artist.&mdash;By that time, tired, unprepared,
in ruin as she was, she had rallied a little. When&mdash;on
Ann Boleyn's hearing the coronation music
of her rival, the heroine searches for her own
crown on her brow&mdash;Madame Pasta turned in the
direction of the festive sounds, the old irresistible
charm broke out;&mdash;nay, even in the final song,
with its <i>roulades</i>, and its scales of shakes, ascending
by a semi-tone, the consummate vocalist and
tragedian, able to combine form with meaning&mdash;the
moment of the situation, with such personal
and musical display as form an integral part of
operatic art&mdash;was indicated: at least to the apprehension
of a younger artist.&mdash;'You are right!'
was Madame Viardot's quick and heartfelt response
(her eyes were full of tears) to a friend
beside her&mdash;'You are right! It is like the <i>Cenacolo</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of Da Vinci at Milan&mdash;a wreck of a picture,
but the picture is the greatest picture in the
world!'"</p>

<p>The great Mme. Viardot herself, whose intractable
voice and noble stage presence inevitably remind
one of Mme. Pasta, took no chances with
fate. The friend of Alfred de Musset, the model
for George Sand's "Consuelo," the "creator" of
Fid&egrave;s in <i>Le Proph&egrave;te</i>, and the singer who, in the
revival of <i>Orph&eacute;e</i> at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Lyrique in 1859,
resuscitated Gluck's popularity in Paris, retired
from the opera stage in 1863 at the age of 43,
shortly after she had appeared in <i>Alceste!</i> (She
sang in concert occasionally until 1870 or later.)
Thereafter she divided her time principally between
Baden and Paris and became the great
friend of Turgeniev. His very delightful letters
to her have been published. Idleness was abhorrent
to this fine woman and in her middle and old
age she gave lessons, while singers, composers, and
conductors alike came to her for help and advice.
She died in 1910 at the age of 89. Her less celebrated
brother, Manuel Garcia (less celebrated as
a singer; as a teacher he is given the credit for
having restored Jenny Lind's voice. Among his
other pupils Mathilde Marchesi and Marie Tempest
may be mentioned), had died in 1906 at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
age of 101. Her sister, Mme. Malibran, died very
young, in the early Nineteenth Century, before, in
fact, Mme. Viardot had made her d&eacute;but.</p>

<p>Few singers have had the wisdom to follow Mme.
Viardot's excellent example. The great Jenny
Lind, long after her voice had lost its quality, continued
to sing in oratorio and concert. So did
Adelina Patti. Muriel Starr once told me of a parrot
she encountered in Australia. The poor bird
had arrived at the noble age of 117 and was entirely
bereft of feathers. Flapping his stumpy
wings he cried incessantly, "I'll fly, by God, I'll
fly!" So, many singers, having lost their voices,
continue to croak, "I'll sing, by God, I'll sing!"
The Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, himself a man of
considerable years when he published his highly
diverting "Musical Reminiscences," gives us some
extraordinary pictures of senility on the stage at
the close of the Eighteenth Century. There was,
for example, the case of Cecilia Davis, the first
Englishwoman to sustain the part of prima donna
and in that situation was second only to Gabrielli,
whom she even rivalled in neatness of execution.
Mount Edgcumbe found Miss Davies in Florence,
unengaged and poor. A concert was arranged at
which she appeared with her sister. Later she returned
to England ... too old to secure an <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>engagement.
"This unfortunate woman is now (in
1834) living in London, in the extreme of old age,
disease, and poverty," writes the Earl. He also
speaks of a Signora Galli, of large and masculine
figure and contralto voice, who frequently filled the
part of second man at the Opera. She had been
a principal singer in Handel's oratorios when conducted
by himself. She afterwards fell into extreme
poverty, and at the age of about seventy
(!!!!), was induced to come forward to sing again
at the oratorios. "I had the curiosity to go, and
heard her sing <i>He was despised and rejected of
men</i> in <i>The Messiah</i>. Of course her voice was
cracked and trembling, but it was easy to see her
school was good; and it was a pleasure to observe
the kindness with which she was received and listened
to; and to mark the animation and delight
with which she seemed to hear again the music in
which she had formerly been a distinguished performer.
The poor old woman had been in the
habit of coming to me annually for a trifling
present; and she told me on that occasion that
nothing but the severest distress should have compelled
her so to expose herself, which after all, did
not answer to its end, as she was not paid according
to her agreement. She died shortly after."
In 1783 the Earl heard a singer named Allegranti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
in Dresden, then at the height of her powers.
Later she returned to England and reappeared in
Cimarosa's <i>Matrimonio Segreto</i>. "Never was
there a more pitiable attempt: she had scarcely a
thread of voice remaining, nor the power to sing
a note in tune: her figure and acting were equally
altered for the worse, and after a few nights she
was obliged to retire and quit the stage altogether."
The celebrated Madame Mara, after a
long sojourn in Russia, suddenly returned to England
and was announced for a benefit performance
at the King's Theatre after everybody had forgotten
her existence. "She must have been at
least seventy; but it was said that her voice had
miraculously returned, and was as good as ever.
But when she displayed those wonderfully revived
powers, they proved, as might have been expected,
lamentably deficient, and the tones she produced
were compared to those of a <i>penny trumpet</i>.
Curiosity was so little excited that the concert
was ill attended ... and Madame Mara was
heard no more. I was not so lucky (or so unlucky)
as to hear these her last notes, as it was
early in the winter, and I was not in town. She
returned to Russia, and was a great sufferer by
the burning of Moscow. After that she lived at
Mitlau, or some other town near the Baltic, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
she died at a great age, not many years ago."</p>

<p>Here is Michael Kelly's account of the same
event: "With all her great skill and knowledge
of the world, Madame Mara was induced, by the
advice of some of her mistaken friends, to give a
public concert at the King's Theatre, in her
seventy-second year, when, in the course of nature
her powers had failed her. It was truly grievous
to see such transcendent talents as she once possessed,
so sunk&mdash;so fallen. I used every effort in
my power to prevent her committing herself, but in
vain. Among other arguments to draw her from
her purpose, I told her what happened to Monbelli,
one of the first tenors of his day, who lost
all his well-earned reputation and fame, by rashly
performing the part of a lover, at the Pergola
Theatre, at Florence, in his seventieth year, having
totally lost his voice. On the stage, he was hissed;
and the following lines, lampooning his attempt,
were chalked on his house-door, as well as upon
the walls of the city:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>'All' et&agrave; di settanta</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Non si ama, n&egrave; si canta.'"</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>W. T. Parke, forty years principal oboe player
at Covent Garden Theatre, is kinder to Madame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Mara in his "Musical Memoirs," but it must be
taken into account that he is kinder to every one
else, too. There is little of the acrimonious or the
fault-finding note in his pages. This is his version
of the affair: "That extraordinary singer of
former days, Madame Mara, who had passed the
last eighteen years in Russia, and who had lately
arrived in England, gave a concert at the King's
Theatre on the 6th of March (1820), which highly
excited the curiosity of the musical public. On
that occasion she sang some of her best airs; and
though her powers were greatly inferior to what
they were in her zenith, yet the same pure taste
pervaded her performance. Whether vanity or
interest stimulated Mara at her time of life to that
undertaking, it would be difficult to determine; but
whichsoever had the ascendency, her reign was
short; for by singing one night afterwards at the
vocal concert, the veil which had obscured her
judgment was removed, and she retired to enjoy
in private life those comforts which her rare talent
had procured for her."</p>

<p>Parke also speaks of a Mrs. Pinto, "the once
celebrated Miss Brent, the original Mandane in
Arne's <i>Artaxerxes</i>," who appeared in 1785 at the
age of nearly seventy in Milton's <i>Mask of Comus</i>
at a benefit for a Mr. Hull, "the respectable stage-manager<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of Covent Garden Theatre." She was to
sing the song of Sweet Echo and as Parke was to
play the responses to her voice on the oboe he repaired
to her house for rehearsal. "Although
nearly seventy years old, her voice possessed the
remains of those qualities for which it had been so
much celebrated,&mdash;power, flexibility, and sweetness.
On the night <i>Comus</i> was performed she
sung with an unexpected degree of excellence, and
was loudly applauded. This old lady, as a
singer, gave me the idea of a fine piece of ruins,
which though considerably dilapidated, still displayed
some of its original beauties."</p>

<p>The celebrated Faustina, whose quarrel with
Cuzzoni is as famous in the history of music as the
war between Gluck and Piccinni, was less daring.
Dr. Burney visited her when she was seventy-two
years old and asked her to sing. "Alas, I cannot,"
she replied, "I have lost all my faculties."</p>

<p>La Camargo, the favourite dancer of Paris in
the early Eighteenth Century, the inventor, indeed
of the short ballet skirt, and the possessor of
many lovers, retired from the stage in 1751 with
a large fortune, besides a pension of fifteen hundred
francs. Thenceforth she led a secluded life.
She was an assiduous visitor to the poor of her
parish and she kept a dozen dogs and an angora<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
cat which she overwhelmed with affection. In that
quaint book, "The Powder Puff," by Franz Blei,
you may find a most charming description of a
call paid to the lady in 1768 in her little old house
in the Rue St. Thomas du Louvre, by Duclos,
Grimm, and Helvetius, who had come in bantering
mood to ask her whom, in her past life, she had
loved best. Her reply touched these men, who
took their leave. "Helvetius told Camargo's
story to his wife; Grimm made a note of it for his
Court Journal; and as for Duclos, it suggested
some moral reflections to him, for when, two years
later, Mlle. Marianne Camargo was carried to her
grave, he remarked: 'It is quite fitting to give
her a white pall like a virgin.'"</p>

<p>Sophie Arnould, one of the most celebrated actresses
and singers of the Eighteenth Century, died
in poverty at the age of 63 and there is no record
of her burial place. She had been the friend
of Voltaire, Rousseau, d'Alembert, Diderot, Helvetius,
and the Baron d'Holbach. She had "created"
Gluck's <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Aulide</i> and the composer
had said of her, "If it had not been for the
voice and elocution of Mlle. Arnould, my <i>Iphig&eacute;nie</i>
would never have been performed in France."
In her youth she had interested not only Marie
Antoinette but also the King, and she had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the object of Mme. de Pompadour's suspicion and
Mme. du Barry's rage. Garrick declared her a
better actress than Clairon. She was as famous
for her wit as for her singing and acting. When
Mme. Laguerre appeared drunk in <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en
Tauride</i> she exclaimed, "Why this is <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en
Champagne</i>!" Indeed, she made so many remarks
worthy of preservation that shortly after
her death in 1802, a book called "Arnoldiana,"
devoted to her epigrams, was issued.... Nevertheless,
this lady was hissed at the age of 36, when,
after a short absence from the stage she reappeared
as Iphig&eacute;nie in 1776. She was neither old
nor ugly and if her voice may have lost something
her nineteen years of stage life in Paris might
have weighed against that. On one occasion, according
to La Harpe, when she had the line to sing,
"You long for me to be gone," the audience applauded
vociferously. To protect Sophie, Marie
Antoinette sat in a box on several nights and
stemmed the storm of disapproval, but in the end
even the presence of the queen herself was insufficient
to quell the hissing. One sad story completes
the picture. In 1785, when her financial
troubles were beginning, her two sons, who bore
her no love, called for money. She had none to
give them. "There are two horses left in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
stable," she said. "Take those." They rode
away on the horses.</p>

<p>Latin audiences are notoriously unfaithful to
their stage favourites. In "The Innocents
Abroad" Mark Twain tells us of the bad manners
of an Italian audience. The singer he mentions
is Erminia Frezzolini, born at Orvieto in 1818.
She sang both in England and America. Chorley
said of her: "She was an elegant, tall woman,
born with a lovely voice, and bred with great vocal
skill (of a certain order); but she was the first
who arrived of the 'young Italians'&mdash;of those
who fancy that driving the voice to its extremities
can stand in the stead of passion. But she was,
nevertheless, a real singer, and her art stood her
in stead for some years after nature broke down.
When she had left her scarce a note of her rich and
real soprano voice to scream with, Madame Frezzolini
was still charming." She died in Paris,
November 5, 1884. Now for Mark Twain:</p>

<p>"I said I knew nothing against the upper classes
from personal observation. I must recall it. I
had forgotten. What I saw their bravest and
their fairest do last night, the lowest multitude
that could be scraped out of the purlieus of Christendom
would blush to do, I think. They assembled
by hundreds, and even thousands, in the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Theatre of San Carlo to do&mdash;what? Why simply
to make fun of an old woman&mdash;to deride, to
hiss, to jeer at an actress they once worshipped,
but whose beauty is faded now, and whose voice
has lost its former richness. Everybody spoke of
the rare sport there was to be. They said the
theatre would be crammed because Frezzolini was
going to sing. It was said she could not sing well
now, but then the people liked to see her, anyhow.
And so we went. And every time the woman sang
they hissed and laughed&mdash;the whole magnificent
house&mdash;and as soon as she left the stage they
called her on again with applause. Once or twice
she was encored five and six times in succession,
and received with hisses when she appeared, and
discharged with hisses and laughter when she had
finished&mdash;then instantly encored and insulted
again! And how the high-born knaves enjoyed
it! White-kidded gentlemen and ladies laughed
till the tears came, and clapped their hands in
very ecstasy when that unhappy old woman would
come meekly out for the sixth time, with uncomplaining
patience, to meet a storm of hisses! It
was the cruellest exhibition&mdash;the most wanton,
the most unfeeling. The singer would have conquered
an audience of American rowdies by her
brave, unflinching tranquillity (for she answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
encore after encore, and smiled and bowed pleasantly,
and sang the best she possibly could, and
went bowing off, through all the jeers and hisses,
without ever losing countenance or temper); and
surely in any other land than Italy her sex and her
helplessness must have been an ample protection
for her&mdash;she could have needed no other. Think
what a multitude of small souls were crowded into
that theatre last night!"</p>

<p>English audiences, on the other hand, are notoriously
friendly to their old favourites. When Dr.
Hanslick, the Viennese critic, visited England and
heard Sims Reeves singing before crowded houses
as he had been doing for forty or fifty years, he
remarked, "It is not easy to win the favour of the
English public; to lose it is quite impossible."</p>

<p>Mme. Grisi made her last appearance in London
in 1866 at the theatre she had left twenty years
previously, Her Majesty's. The opera was <i>Lucrezia
Borgia</i>. At the end of the first act she
miscalculated the depth of the apron and the descending
curtain left her outside on her knees.
She had stiffness in her joints and was unable to
rise without assistance.... This situation must
have been very embarassing to a singer who previously
had been an idol of the public. In the passionate
duet with the tenor she made an unsuccessful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
attempt to reach the A natural. Notwithstanding
the fact that she was well received and
that she got through with the greater part of the
opera with credit, her impressario, J. H. Mapleson,
relates in his "Memoirs" that after the final
curtain had fallen she rushed to tell him that it
was all over and that she would never appear
again. In "Student and Singer" Charles Santley
writes of the occasion: "I had been singing
at the Crystal Palace concert in the afternoon,
and after dining there I went up to the theatre
to see a little of the performance. I felt very
sorry for Grisi that she had been induced to appear
again; it was a sad sight for any one who had
known her in her prime, and even long past it."</p>

<p>However, even English audiences can be cold.
John E. Cox, in his "Musical Recollections," recalls
an earlier occasion when Grisi sang at the
Crystal Palace without much success (July 31,
1861): "On retiring from the orchestra, after a
peculiarly cold reception&mdash;as unkind as it was inconsiderate,
seeing what the career of this remarkable
woman had been&mdash;there was not a single person
at the foot of the orchestra to receive or to
accompany her to her retiring room! I could imagine
what her feelings at that moment must have
been&mdash;she who had in former years been accustomed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
to be thronged, wherever she appeared, and
to be the recipient of adulation&mdash;often as exaggerated
as it was fulsome&mdash;but who was now
literally deserted. With Grisi&mdash;although I had
been once or twice introduced to her&mdash;I never had
any personal acquaintance. I could not, however,
resist the impulse of preceding her, without obtruding
myself on her notice, and opening the door
of the retiring room for her, which was situated at
some considerable distance from the orchestra.
Her look as I did this, and she passed out of sight,
is amongst the most painful of my 'Recollections.'"</p>

<p>German audiences are usually kind to their
favourites. In America we adopt neither the attitude
of the English and Germans, nor yet that
of the Italians and French. We simply stay away
from the theatre. Mark Twain has put it succinctly,
"When a singer has lost his voice and a
jumper his legs, those parties fail to draw."</p>

<p>Benjamin Lumley in his "Reminiscences of the
Opera," quoting an anonymous friend, relates a
touching story regarding Catalani, who was born
in 1779 and who retired from the stage in 1831.
When Jenny Lind visited Paris in the spring of
1849 she learned to her astonishment that Catalani
was in the French capital. The old singer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
who resided habitually in Florence, had come to
Paris with her daughter who, as the widow of a
Frenchman, was obliged to go through certain
legal forms before taking possession of her share
of her husband's property. Through a friend of
both ladies it was arranged that the two should
meet at a dinner at the home of the Marquis of
Normansby, the English ambassador to the Tuscan
court, but the Swedish singer could not restrain
her impatience and before that event she
set out one forenoon for Mme. Catalani's apartment
in the Rue de la Paix and sent in her name
by a servant. The old singer hastened out to
greet her distinguished visitor with obvious delight.
She had known nothing of Mlle. Lind's
presence in Paris and had feared that such a
chance would never befall her, much as she had
longed to see the celebrated singer who had excited
the English public in a way which recalled
her own past triumphs and who rivalled her in her
purity and her charity. They talked together
for an hour.... At the dinner the Marchioness
of Normansby considerately refrained from asking
Jenny Lind to sing, because no one is allowed to
refuse such an invitation made by a representative
of royalty. Catalani, however, had no such scruples.
She went up to the Nightingale and begged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
her to sing, adding, "<i>C'est la vieille Catalini qui
desire vous entendre chanter, avant de mourir!</i>"
This appeal was irresistible. Jenny Lind sat
down to the piano and sang <i>Non credea
mirarti</i> and one or two other airs, including <i>Ah!
non giunge</i>. Catalani is described as sitting on
an ottoman in the centre of the room, rocking her
body to and fro with delight and sympathy, murmuring,
"<i>Ah la bella cosa che la musica, quando
si f&agrave; di quella maniera!</i>" and again "<i>Ah! la carissima!
quanto bellissima!</i>" A dinner at Catalani's
apartment followed, but a few days later it
became known that the old singer was ill, an illness
which proved fatal. She had, however,
heard the Swedish Nightingale sing "<i>avant de
mourir</i>."</p>

<p>William Gardiner visited Madame Catalani in
1846. "I was surprised at the vigour of Madame
Catalani," he says, "and how little she has altered
since I saw her in Derby in 1828. I paid
her a compliment on her good looks. 'Ah,' said
she, 'I'm sixty-six!' She has lost none of that
commanding expression which gave her such dignity
on the stage. She is without a wrinkle, and
appears to be no more than forty. Her breadth
of chest is still remarkable: it is this which endowed
her with the finest voice that ever sang.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Her speaking voice and dramatic air are still
charming, and not in the least impaired."</p>

<p>Is Christine Nilsson still alive? I think so.
She was born August 20, 1843. In Clara Louise
Kellogg's very entertaining, but not always trustworthy,
"Memoirs" there is an interesting reference
to this singer in her later career. Dates, unfortunately,
are not furnished. "I was present,"
declares Mme. Kellogg, "on the night ... when
she practically murdered the high register of her
voice. She had five upper notes the quality of
which was unlike any other I ever heard and that
possessed a peculiar charm. The tragedy happened
during a performance of <i>The Magic Flute</i>
in London.... Nilsson was the Queen of the
Night, one of her most successful early r&ocirc;les.
The second aria in <i>The Magic Flute</i> is more famous
and less difficult than the first aria, and also,
more effective. Nilsson knew well the ineffectiveness
of the ending of the first aria in the two weakest
notes of a soprano's voice, A natural and B
flat. I never could understand why a master like
Mozart should have chosen to use them as he did.
There is no climax to the song. One has to climb
up hard and fast and then stop short in the middle.
It is an appalling thing to do and that night
Nilsson took those two notes at the last in <i>chest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
tones</i>. 'Great heavens!' I gasped, 'what is she
doing? What is the woman thinking of!' Of
course I knew she was doing it to get volume and
vibration and to give that trying climax some
character. But to say that it was a fatal attempt
is to put it mildly. She absolutely killed a certain
quality in her voice there and then and she <i>never
recovered it</i>. Even that night she had to cut out
the second great aria. Her beautiful high notes
were gone forever." As I have said, the date of
this incident, which, so far as I know, is not recorded
elsewhere, is not mentioned, but Christine
Nilsson sang in New York in the early Eighties
and continued to sing until 1891, the year of her
final appearance in London.</p>

<p>Adelina Patti, born the same year as Nilsson
but six months before (February 10, 1843; according
to some records, which by no means go undisputed,
a quartet of famous singers came into the
world this year. The other two were Ilma de
Murska and Pauline Lucca) made many farewell
tours of this country ... one too many in
1903-4, when she displayed the <i>beaux restes</i> of her
voice. She is living at present in retirement at
Craig-y-Nos in Wales. Her greatest rival,
Etelka Gerster, too, is alive, I believe.</p>

<p>Lilli Lehmann, one of the oldest of the living<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
great singers, was born May 13, 1848. She was
a member of the famous casts which introduced
many of the Wagner works to New York. Her
last appearances in opera here were made, I think,
in the late Nineties, but she has sung here since in
concert and in Germany she has frequently assisted
at the performances of the Mozart festivals at
Salzburg and has even sung in <i>Norma</i> and <i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i>
within recent years! Her head is now
crowned with white hair and her noble appearance
and magnificent style in singing have doubtless
stood her in good stead at these belated performances,
which probably were disappointing,
judged as vocal exhibitions.</p>

<p>Lillian Nordica had a long career. She was
born May 12, 1859, and made her operatic d&eacute;but
in Brescia in <i>La Traviata</i> in 1879. She continued
to sing up to the time of her death in Batavia,
Java, May 10, 1914. Indeed she was then undertaking
a concert tour of the world at the age of
55! But the artist, who in the Nineties had held
the Metropolitan Opera House stage with honour
in the great dramatic r&ocirc;les, had very little to offer
in her last years. Never a great musician, defects
in style began to make themselves evident as her
vocal powers decreased. Her season at the Manhattan
Opera House in 1907-8 was quickly and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
unpleasantly terminated. A subsequent single appearance
as Isolde at the Metropolitan in the
winter of 1909-10 was even less successful. The
voice had lost its resonance, the singer her appeal.
Her magnificent courage and indomitable ambition
urged her on to the end.</p>

<p>Two singers whose voices have been miraculously
preserved, who have indeed suffered little
from the ravages of time, are Marcella Sembrich
and Nellie Melba. Both of these singers, however,
have consistently refrained from misusing
their voices (if one may except the one occasion on
which Mme. Melba attempted to sing Br&uuml;nnhilde
in <i>Siegfried</i> with disastrous results). Mme.
Melba (according to Grove's Dictionary, which,
like all other books devoted to the subject of
music, is frequently inaccurate) was born in Australia,
May 19, 1859. Therefore she was 28
years old when she made her d&eacute;but in Brussels as
Gilda on October 12, 1887. She has used her
voice carefully and well and still sings in concert
and opera at the age of 59. With the advance of
age, indeed, her voice began to take on colour.
When she sang here in opera at the Manhattan
Opera House in 1906-7 she was in her best vocal
estate. Her voice, originally rather pale, had become
mellow and rich, although it is possible it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
lost some of its old remarkable agility. When
last I listened to her in concert, a few years ago at
the Hippodrome, it seemed to me that I had never
before heard so beautiful a voice, and yet Mme.
Melba sang in the first performance of opera I
ever attended (Chicago Auditorium; <i>Faust</i>, February
22, 1899).</p>

<p>According to H. T. Finck, Caruso once said,
"When you hear that an artist is going to retire,
don't you believe it, for as long as he keeps
his voice he will sing. You may depend upon
that." Sometimes, indeed, longer. Mme. Melba
made a belated and unfortunate attempt to sing
Marguerite in <i>Faust</i> with the Chicago Opera Company,
Monday evening, February 4, 1918, at the
Lexington Theatre, New York. She sang with
some art and style; her tone was still pure and
her wonderful enunciation still remained a feature
of her performance but scarcely a shadow of the
beautiful voice I can remember so well was left.
As if to atone for vocal deficiencies the singer
made histrionic efforts such as she had never
deemed necessary during the height of her career.
Her meeting with Faust in the Kermesse scene was
accomplished with modesty that almost became
fright. She nearly danced the jewel song and embraced
the tenor with passion in the love duet. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
the church scene, overcome with terror at the sight
of M&eacute;phistoph&eacute;l&egrave;s, she flung her prayer book
across the stage.... Her appearance was almost
shocking and the first lines of the part of Marguerite,
"<i>Non monsieur, je ne suis demoiselle, ni
belle</i>" had a merciless application. However, the
audience received her with kindness, more with a
certain sort of enthusiasm. She reappeared again
in the same opera on Thursday evening, February
14, 1918, but on this occasion I did not hear her.</p>

<p>Marcella Sembrich was born February 15, 1858.
She made her d&eacute;but in Athens in <i>I Puritani</i>,
June 8, 1877, and she made her New York
d&eacute;but in <i>Lucia</i> October 24, 1883, at the beginning
of the first season of the Metropolitan
Opera House. After a long absence she returned
to New York in 1898 as Rosina in <i>Il
Barbiere</i>. After that year she sang pretty
steadily at the Metropolitan until February 6,
1909, when, at the age of 51 (or lacking nine days
of it), she bid farewell to the New York opera
stage in acts from several of her favourite operas.
She subsequently sang in a few performances of
opera in Europe and was heard in song recital in
America. When she left the opera house she had
no rival in vocal artistry; and she had so satisfactorily
solved the problems of style in singing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
certain kinds of songs that she also surveyed the
field of song recital from a mountain top....
But such a singer as Mme. Sembrich, who made
her appeal through the expression of the milder
emotions, who never, indeed, attempted to touch
dramatic depths, even style, in the end, will not
assist. Magnificent Lilli Lehmann might make a
certain effect in <i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i> so long as she
had a leg to stand on or a note to croak, but an
adequate delivery of <i>Der Nussbaum</i> or <i>Wie Melodien</i>
demands a vocal control which a singer past
middle age is not always sure of possessing....
After a long retirement, Mme. Sembrich gave a
concert at Carnegie Hall, November 21, 1915.
The house was crowded and the applause at the
beginning must almost have unnerved the singer,
who walked slowly towards the front of the platform
as the storm burst and then bowed her head
again and again. Her program on this occasion
was not one of her best. She had not chosen familiar
songs in which to return to her public.
This may in a measure account for her lack of success
in always calling forth steady tones. However,
on the whole, her voice sounded amazingly
fresh. Her high notes especially rang true and
resonant as ever. Her middle voice showed wear.
Her style remained impeccable, unrivalled....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
She announced, following this concert, a series of
four recitals in a small hall and actually appeared
at one of them. This time I did not hear her, but
I am told that her voice refused to respond to her
wishes. Nor was the hall filled. The remaining
concerts were abandoned. "Mme. Sembrich has
never been a failure and she is too old to begin
now!" she is reported to have said to a friend.</p>

<p>Emma Calv&eacute;'s date of birth is recorded as 1864
in some of the musical dictionaries. This would
make her 53 years old. Her singing of the <i>Marseillaise</i>
a year ago at the Allies Bazaar at the
Grand Central Palace proved to me that her retirement
from the Opera was premature. Her
performances at the Manhattan Opera House in
1906-7 were memorable, vocally superb. Her
Carmen was out of drawing dramatically, but her
Anita and her Santuzza remained triumphs of
stage craft.</p>

<p>Emma Eames, born August 13, 1867, is three
years younger than Mme. Calv&eacute;. She made her
d&eacute;but as Juliette, March 13, 1889. She retired
from the opera stage in 1907-8, although she has
sung since then a few times in concert. Her last
appearances at the Opera were made in dramatic
r&ocirc;les, Donna Anna, Leonora (in <i>Trovatore</i>), and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Tosca, in contradistinction to the lyric parts in
which she gained her early fame. That she was
entirely successful in compassing the breach cannot
be said in all justice. Yet there was a certain
distinction in her manner, a certain acid quality in
her voice, that gave force to these characterizations.
Certainly, however, no one would ever
have compared her Donna Anna favourably with
her Countess in <i>Figaro</i>. Her performance of <i>Or
sai chi l'onore</i> was deficient in breadth of style and
her lack of breath control at this period gave uncertainty
to her execution.</p>

<p>Life teaches us, through experience, that no rule
is infallible, but insofar as I am able to give a
meaning to these rambling biographical notes, collected,
I may as well admit, more to interest my
reader than to prove anything, it is the meaning,
sounded with a high note of truth, by Arthur Symons,
in the paragraph quoted at the beginning
of this essay. Style is a rare quality in a singer.
With it in his possession an artist may dare much
for a long time. Without it he exists as long as
those qualities which are perfectly natural to him
exist. A voice fades, but a manner of applying
that voice (even when there is practically no voice
to apply) to an artistic problem has an indefinite
term of life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Yvette Guilbert once told me that crossing the
Atlantic with Duse on one occasion she had asked
the Italian actress if she were going to include <i>La
Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias</i> in her American repertory.
"I am too old to play Marguerite ..." was the
sad response. "She was right," said Guilbert, in
relating the incident, "she was too old; she was
born too old ... in spirit. Now when I am
sixty-three I shall begin to impersonate children.
I grow younger every year!"</p>

<p>An idle observer of theatrical conditions
might derive a certain ironic pleasure from
remarking the contradiction implied in the
professed admiration of the constables of the
playhouse for the unconventional and their almost
passionate adoration for the conventional. We
constantly hear it said that the public cries for
novelty, and just as constantly we see the same
kind of acting, the same gestures, the same Julian
Mitchellisms and George Marionisms and Ned
Wayburnisms repeated in and out of season, summer
and winter. Indeed, certain conventions
(which bore us even now) are so deeply rooted in
the soil of our theatre that I see no hope of their
being eradicated before the year 1999, at which
date other conventions will have supplanted them
and will likewise have become tiresome.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>In this respect our theatre does not differ materially
from the theatres of other countries except
in one particular. In Europe the juxtaposition
of nations makes an interchange of conventions
possible, which brings about slow change or
rapid revolution. Paris, for example, has received
visits from the Russian Ballet which almost assumed
the proportions of Tartar invasions.
London, too, has been invaded by the Russians
and by the Irish. The Irish playwrights, indeed,
are continually pounding away at British middle-class
complacency. Germany, in turn, has been
invaded by England (we regret that this sentence
has only an artistic and figurative significance),
and we find Max Reinhardt well on his way toward
giving a complete cycle of the plays of Shakespeare;
a few years ago we might have observed
Deutschland groveling hysterically before Oscar
Wilde's <i>Salome</i>, a play which, at least without its
musical dress, has not, I believe, even yet been performed
publicly in London. In Italy, of course,
there are no artistic invasions (nobody cares to
pay for them) and even the conventions of the
Italian theatre themselves, such as the <i>Commedia
del' Arte</i>, are quite dead; so the country remains
as dormant, artistically speaking, as a rag rug,
until an enthusiast like Marinetti arises to take it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
between his teeth and shake it back into rags
again.</p>

<p>Very often whisperings of art life in the foreign
theatre (such as accounts of Stanislavski's accomplishments
in Moscow) cross the Atlantic.
Very often the husks of the realities (as was the
case with the Russian Ballet) are imported. But
whispers and husks have about as much influence
as the "New York Times" in a mayoralty campaign,
and as a result we find the American theatre
as little aware of world activities in the drama as
a deaf mute living on a pole in the desert of
Sahara would be. Indeed any intrepid foreign
investigator who wishes to study the American
drama, American acting, and American stage decoration
will find them in almost as virgin a condition
as they were in the time of Lincoln.</p>

<p>A few rude assaults have been made on this
smug eupepsy. I might mention the coming of
Paul Orleneff, who left Alla Nazimova with us to
be eventually swallowed up in the conventional
American theatre. Four or five years ago a company
of Negro players at the Lafayette Theatre
gave a performance of a musical revue that
boomed like the big bell in the Kremlin at Moscow.
Nobody could be deaf to the sounds. Florenz
Ziegfeld took over as many of the tunes and gestures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
as he could buy for his <i>Follies</i> of that
season, but he neglected to import the one essential
quality of the entertainment, its style, for
the exploitation of which Negro players were indispensable.
For the past two months Mimi
Aguglia, one of the greatest actresses of the world,
has been performing in a succession of classic and
modern plays (a repertory comprising dramas by
Shakespeare, d'Annunzio, and Giacosa) at the
Garibaldi Theatre, on East Fourth Street, before
very large and very enthusiastic audiences, but
uptown culture and managerial acumen will not
awaken to the importance of this gesture until they
read about it in some book published in 1950....</p>

<p>All of which is merely by way of prelude to what
I feel must be something in the nature of lyric outburst
and verbal explosion. A few nights ago a
Spanish company, unheralded, unsung, indeed almost
unwelcomed by such reviewers as had to
trudge to the out-of-the-way Park Theatre, came
to New York, in a musical revue entitled <i>The
Land of Joy</i>. The score was written by Joaqu&iacute;n
Valverde, <i>fils</i>, whose music is not unknown to us,
and the company included La Argentina, a Spanish
dancer who had given matinees here in a past season
without arousing more than mild enthusiasm.
The theatrical impressarii, the song publishers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
and the Broadway rabble stayed away on the first
night. It was all very well, they might have reasoned,
to read about the goings on in Spain, but
they would never do in America. Spanish dancers
had been imported in the past without awakening
undue excitement. Did not the great Carmencita
herself visit America twenty or more years ago?
These impressarii had ignored the existence of a
great psychological (or more properly physiological)
truth: you cannot mix Burgundy and Beer!
One Spanish dancer surrounded by Americans is
just as much lost as the great Nijinsky himself
was in an English music hall, where he made a
complete and dismal failure. And so they would
have been very much astonished (had they been
present) on the opening night to have witnessed
all the scenes of uncontrollable enthusiasm&mdash;just
as they are described by Havelock Ellis, Richard
Ford, and Chabrier&mdash;repeated. The audience,
indeed, became hysterical, and broke into wild
cries of <i>Ole! Ole!</i> Hats were thrown on the stage.
The audience became as abandoned as the players,
became a part of the action.</p>

<p>You will find all this described in "The Soul of
Spain," in "Gatherings from Spain," in Chabrier's
letters, and it had all been transplanted to New
York almost without a whisper of preparation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
which is fortunate, for if it had been expected,
doubtless we would have found the way to spoil it.
Fancy the average New York first-night audience,
stiff and unbending, sceptical and sardonic, welcoming
this exhibition! Havelock Ellis gives an
ingenious explanation for the fact that Spanish
dancing has seldom if ever successfully crossed the
border of the Iberian peninsula: "The finest
Spanish dancing is at once killed or degraded by
the presence of an indifferent or unsympathetic
public, and that is probably why it cannot be
transplanted, but remains local." Fortunately
the Spaniards in the first-night audience gave the
cue, unlocked the lips and loosened the hands of
us cold Americans. For my part, I was soon yelling
<i>Ole!</i> louder than anybody else.</p>

<p>The dancer, Doloretes, is indeed extraordinary.
The gipsy fascination, the abandoned, perverse
bewitchery of this female devil of the dance is not
to be described by mouth, typewriter, or quilled
pen. Heine would have put her at the head of his
dancing temptresses in his ballet of <i>M&eacute;phistoph&eacute;la</i>
(found by Lumley too indecent for representation
at Her Majesty's Theatre, for which it was written;
in spite of which the scenario was published
in the respectable "Revue de Deux Mondes").<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
In this ballet a series of dancing celebrities are exhibited
by the female M&eacute;phistoph&eacute;l&egrave;s for the entertainment
of her victim. After Salome had twisted
her flanks and exploited the prowess of her abdominal
muscles to perfunctory applause, Doloretes
would have heated the blood, not only of Faust,
but of the ladies and gentlemen in the orchestra
stalls, with the clicking of her heels, the clacking of
her castanets, now held high over head, now held
low behind her back, the flashing of her ivory teeth,
the shrill screaming, electric magenta of her smile,
the wile of her wriggle, the passion of her performance.
And close beside her the sinuous Mazantinita
would flaunt a garish tambourine and
wave a shrieking fan. All inanimate objects,
shawls, mantillas, combs, and cymbals, become inflamed
with life, once they are pressed into the service
of these se&ntilde;oritas, languorous and forbidding,
indifferent and sensuous. Against these rude gipsies
the refined grace and Goyaesque elegance of
La Argentina stand forth in high relief, La Argentina,
in whose hands the castanets become as potent
an instrument for our pleasure as the violin does in
the fingers of Jascha Heifetz. Bilbao, too, with
his thundering heels and his tauromachian gestures,
bewilders our highly magnetized senses. When, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the dance, he pursues, without catching, the elusive
Doloretes, it would seem that the limit of dynamic
effects in the theatre had been reached.</p>

<p>Here are singers! The limpid and lovely
soprano of the comparatively placid Maria Marco,
who introduces figurations into the brilliant music
she sings at every turn. One indecent (there is
no other word for it) chromatic oriental phrase is
so strange that none of us can ever recall it or
forget it! And the frantically nervous Luisita
Puchol, whose eyelids spring open like the cover
of a Jack-in-the-box, and whose hands flutter
like saucy butterflies, sings suggestive popular
ditties just a shade better than any one else I
know of.</p>

<p>But <i>The Land of Joy</i> does not rely on one or
two principals for its effect. The organization as
a whole is as full of fire and purpose as the original
Russian Ballet; the costumes themselves, in
their blazing, heated colours, constitute the ingredients
of an orgy; the music, now sentimental (the
adaptability of Valverde, who has lived in Paris, is
little short of amazing; there is a vocal waltz in the
style of Arditi that Mme. Patti might have introduced
into the lesson scene of <i>Il Barbiere</i>; there is
another song in the style of George M. Cohan&mdash;these
by way of contrast to the Iberian music),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
now pulsing with rhythmic life, is the best Spanish
music we have yet heard in this country. The
whole entertainment, music, colours, costumes,
songs, dances, and all, is as nicely arranged in its
crescendos and decrescendos, its prestos and
adagios as a Mozart finale. The close of the first
act, in which the ladies sweep the stage with long
ruffled trains, suggestive of all the Manet pictures
you have ever seen, would seem to be unapproachable,
but the most striking costumes and the wildest
dancing are reserved for the very last scene
of all. There these bewildering se&ntilde;oritas come
forth in the splendourous envelope of embroidered
Manila shawls, and such shawls! Prehistoric
African roses of unbelievable measure decorate a
texture of turquoise, from which depends nearly a
yard of silken fringe. In others mingle royal purple
and buff, orange and white, black and the
kaleidoscope! The revue, a sublimated form of
zarzuela, is calculated, indeed, to hold you in a
dangerous state of nervous excitement during the
entire evening, to keep you awake for the rest
of the night, and to entice you to the theatre the
next night and the next. It is as intoxicating as
vodka, as insidious as cocaine, and it is likely to
become a habit, like these stimulants. I have
found, indeed, that it appeals to all classes of taste,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
from that of a telephone operator, whose usual
artistic debauch is the latest antipyretic novel of
Robert W. Chambers, to that of the frequenter of
the concert halls.</p>

<p>I cannot resist further cataloguing; details
shake their fists at my memory; for instance, the
intricate rhythms of Valverde's elaborately syncopated
music (not at all like ragtime syncopation),
the thrilling orchestration (I remember one dance
which is accompanied by drum taps and oboe,
nothing else!), the utter absence of tangos (which
are Argentine), and habaneras (which are Cuban),
most of the music being written in two-four and
three-four time, and the interesting use of folk-tunes;
the casual and very suggestive indifference
of the dancers, while they are not dancing, seemingly
models for a dozen Zuloaga paintings, the
apparently inexhaustible skill and variety of these
dancers in action, winding ornaments around the
melodies with their feet and bodies and arms and
heads and castanets as coloratura sopranos do with
their voices. Sometimes castanets are not used;
cymbals supplant them, or tambourines, or even
fingers. Once, by some esoteric witchcraft, the
dancers seemed to tap upon their arms. The
effect was so stupendous and terrifying that I
could not project myself into that aloof state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
mind necessary for a calm dissection of its technique.</p>

<p>What we have been thinking of all these years
in accepting the imitation and ignoring the actuality
I don't know; it has all been down in black
and white. What Richard Ford saw and wrote
down in 1846 I am seeing and writing down in
1917. How these devilish Spaniards have been
able to keep it up all this time I can't imagine.
Here we have our paradox. Spain has changed
so little that Ford's book is still the best to be procured
on the subject (you may spend many a delightful
half-hour with the charming irony of its
pages for company). Spanish dancing is apparently
what it was a hundred years ago; no wind
from the north has disturbed it. Stranger still,
it depends for its effect on the acquirement of a
brilliant technique. Merely to play the castanets
requires a severe tutelage. And yet it is all as
spontaneous, as fresh, as unstudied, as vehement
in its appeal, even to Spaniards, as it was in the
beginning. Let us hope that Spain will have no
artistic reawakening.</p>

<p>Aristotle and Havelock Ellis and Louis Sherwin
have taught us that the theatre should be an outlet
for suppressed desires. So, indeed, the ideal
theatre should. As a matter of fact, in most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
playhouses (I will generously refrain from naming
the one I visited yesterday) I am continually
suppressing a desire to strangle somebody or
other, but after a visit to the Spaniards I walk out
into Columbus Circle completely purged of pity
and fear, love, hate, and all the rest. It is an
experience.</p>

<h2>A Note on Mimi Aguglia</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>"Art has to do only with the creation of beauty,
whether it be in words, or sounds, or colour, or outline,
or rhythmical movement; and the man who writes
music is no more truly an artist than the man who
plays that music, the poet who composes rhythms in
words no more truly an artist than the dancer who
composes rhythms with the body, and the one is no
more to be preferred to the other, than the painter is
to be preferred to the sculptor, or the musician to the
poet, in those forms of art which we have agreed to
recognize as of equal value."</i></p>

<p class="author">
Arthur Symons.<br />
</p></div>


<p>The only George Jean, "witty, wise, and
cruel," and the "amaranthine" Louis Sherwin,
who understands better than anybody
else how to plunge the rapier into the vulnerable
spot and twist it in the wound, making the victim
writhe, have been having some fun with the art of
acting lately, or to be exact, with the art of
actors. Now actor-baiting is no new game; as a
winter sport it is as popular as making jokes about
mothers-in-law, decrying the art of Bouguereau or
Howard Chandler Christy, or discussing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
methods of Mr. Belasco. Ever so long ago (and
George Henry Lewes preceded him) George Moore
wrote an article called "Mummer Worship," holding
the players up to ridicule, but George really
adores the theatre and even acting, goes to the
playhouse constantly, and writes a bad play himself
every few years. None of these has achieved
success on the stage. The list includes <i>Martin
Luther</i>, written with a collaborator, <i>The Strike at
Arlingford</i>, <i>The Bending of the Bough</i> (Moore's
version of a play by Edwin Martyn), a dramatization
of "Esther Waters," <i>Elizabeth Cooper</i>, and
the fragment, <i>The Apostle</i>, on which "The Brook
Kerith," was based. Now he is at work turning
the novel back into another play.... When the
Sunday editor of a newspaper is at his wit's end
he invariably sends a competent reporter to collect
data for a symposium on one of two topics, Is
the author or the player more important? or Does
the stage director make the actor? The amount
of amusement this reporter can derive in gathering
indignant replies from mountebanks and scribblers
is only limited by his own sense of humour.
Even the late Sir Henry Irving felt compelled on
more than one occasion to defend his "noble calling."</p>

<p>The actor, when he slaps back, usually overlooks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the point at issue, but sometimes he has something
to say over which we may well ponder.
Witness, for example, the following passage,
quoted from that justly celebrated compendium
of personal opinions and broad-shaft wit called
"Nat Goodwin's Book": "The average author
and manager of today are prone to advertise
themselves as conspicuously as the play (as if the
public cared a snap who wrote the play or who
'presents'). I doubt if five per cent of the public
know who wrote 'The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,'
'In Mizzoura,' or 'Richelieu,' but they know their
stage favourites. I wonder how many mantels are
adorned with pictures of the successful dramatist
and those who 'present' and how many there are
on which appear Maude Adams, Dave Warfield,
Billie Burke, John Drew, Bernhardt, Duse, and
hundreds of other distinguished players."</p>

<p>It is principally urged against the claims of
acting as an art that a young person without previous
experience or training can make an immediate
(and sometimes lasting) effect upon the
stage, whereas in the preparation for any other
art (even the interpretative arts) years of training
are necessary. This premise is full of holes;
nevertheless George Moore, and Messrs. Nathan
and Sherwin all cling to it. It is true that almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
any young girl, moderately gifted with charm or
comeliness, may make an instantaneous impression
on our stage, especially in the namby-pamby r&ocirc;les
which our playwrights usually give her to play.
But she is soon found out. She may still attract
audiences (as George Barr McCutcheon and Alma
Tadema still attract audiences) but the discerning
part of the public will take no joy in seeing her.
Charles Frohman said (and he ought to know)
that the average life of a female star on the American
stage was ten years; in other words, her
career continued as long as her youth and physical
charms remained potent.</p>

<p>We have easily accounted for the unimportant
actors, the rank and file, but what about those who
immediately claim positions which they hold in
spite of their lack of previous training? These
are rarer. At the moment, indeed, I cannot think
of any. For while genius often manifests itself
early in a career, the great actors, as a rule, have
struggled for many years to learn the rudiments
of their art before they have given indisputable
proof of their greatness, or before they have been
recognized. "Real acting," according to Percy
Fitzgerald, "is a science, to be studied and mastered,
as other sciences are studied and mastered,
by long years of training." They may not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
had the strenuous Conservatoire and Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;ais training of Sarah Bernhardt. As a
matter of fact, indeed, the actor may far better
learn to handle his tools by manipulating them
before an audience, than by practicing with them
for too long a time in the closet. The technique
of violin playing can best be acquired before the
<i>virtuoso</i> appears in public, although no amount
of training in itself will make a great violinist, but
the basic elements of acting, grace, diction, etc.,
can just as well be acquired behind the footlights
and so many great actors have acquired them, as
many of the greatest have ignored them. There
can be no hard and fast rules laid down for this
sort of thing. Can we thank nine months with
Mme. Marchesi for the instantaneous success and
subsequent brilliant career of Mme. Melba?
Against this training offset the years and years of
road playing and the more years of study at home
in retirement to account for the career of Mrs.
Fiske. The Australian soprano was born with a
naturally-placed and flexible voice. Her shake
is said to have been perfection when she was a
child; her scale was even; her intonation impeccable.
She had very little to learn except the r&ocirc;les
in the operas she was to sing and her future was
very clearly marked from the night she made her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
d&eacute;but as Gilda in <i>Rigolett&ograve;</i>. Mme. Patti was
equally gifted. Mme. Pasta and Mme. Fremstad,
on the other hand, toiled very slowly towards fame.
The former singer was an absolute failure when
she first appeared in London and it took several
years of hard work to make her the greatest lyric
artist of her day. The great Jenny Lind retired
from the stage completely defeated, only to return
as the most popular singer of her time. Mischa
Elman has told me he never practices; Leo Ornstein,
on the other hand, spends hours every day
at the piano. Mozart sprang, full-armed with
genius, into the world. He began composing at
the age of four. No training was necessary for
him, but Beethoven and Wagner developed slowly.
In the field of writers there are even more happy
examples. Hundreds of boys have spent years in
theme and literature courses in college preparing
in vain for a future which was never to be theirs,
while other youths with no educations have taken
to writing as a cat takes to cat-nip. Should we
assume that the annual output of Professor
Baker's class at Harvard produces better playwrights
than Moli&egrave;re or Shakespeare, neither of
whom enjoyed Professor Baker's lectures, nor, I
think I am safe in conjecturing, anything like
them?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>What, after all, constitutes training? For a
creative or interpretative genius mere existence
seems to be sufficient. Joseph Conrad, Nicholas
Rimsky-Korsakov, and Patrick MacGill all were
sailors for many years before they began to write.
We owe "Youth" and the first section of <i>Scheherazade</i>
to this accident. MacGill also had the
privilege of digging potatoes; he writes about it
in "The Rat-pit." Mrs. Patrick Campbell
learned enough about how to move about and how
to speak in the country houses she frequented
before she began her professional career to enable
her immediately to take a position of importance
on the stage. It does not seem necessary, indeed,
that the training for any career should be prescribed
or systematic. Some men get their training
one way and some another. A school of acting
may be of the greatest benefit to A, while B
will not profit by it. Some actors are ruined by
stock companies; others are improved by them.
The geniuses in this interpretative art as in all
the other interpretative and creative arts, seem to
rise above obstructions, and to make themselves
felt, whatever difficulties are put in their way.</p>

<p>Some great actors, like some great musicians
and authors, create out of their fulness. They
cannot explain; they do not need to study; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
create by instinct. Others, like Beethoven and
Olive Fremstad, work and rework their material
in the closet until it approaches perfection, when
they expose it. To say that there are bad actors
following in the footsteps of both these types of
geniuses is to be axiomatic and trite. It would
be a foregone conclusion. Just as there are musicians
who write as easily as Mozart but who
have nothing to say, so there are other musicians
who write and rewrite, work and rework, study
and restudy, and yet what they finally offer the
public has not the quality or the force or the inspiration
of a common gutter-ballad.</p>

<p>It has also been urged in print that as naturalness
is the goal of the actor he should never have
to strive for it. The names of Frank Reicher and
John Drew are often mentioned as those of men
who "play themselves" on the stage. A most
difficult thing to do! Also an unfortunate choice
of names. Each of these artists has undergone a
long and arduous apprenticeship in order to
achieve the natural method which has given him
eminence in his career. Indeed, of all the qualities
of the actor this is the least easy to acquire.</p>

<p>Actors are often condemned because they are
not versatile. Versatility is undoubtedly an admirable
quality in an actor, valuable, especially to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
his manager, but hardly an essential one. An artist
is not required to do more than one thing well.
Vladimir de Pachmann specializes in Chopin playing,
but Arthur Symons once wrote that "he is the
greatest living pianist, because he can play certain
things better than any other pianist can play
anything." Should we not allot similar approval
to the actor or actress who makes a fine effect in
one part or in one kind of part? I should not call
Ellen Terry a versatile actress, but I should call
her a great artist. Marie Tempest is not versatile,
unless she should be so designated for having
made equal successes on the lyric and dramatic
stages, but she is one of the most satisfying artists
at present appearing before our public. Mallarm&eacute;
was not versatile; C&eacute;zanne was not versatile;
nor was Thomas Love Peacock. Mascagni, assuredly,
is not versatile. The da Vincis and Wagners
are rare figures in the history of creative art
just as the Nijinskys and Rachels are rare in the
history of interpretative art.</p>

<p>Someone may say that the great actor dies while
the play goes thundering on through the ages on
the stage and in everyman's library. This very
point, indeed, is made by Mr. Lewes. But this,
alas, is the reverse of the truth. We have competent
and immensely absorbing records of the lives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
and art of David Garrick, Mrs. Siddons, Ristori,
Clairon, Rachel, Charlotte Cushman, Edwin Booth,
and other prominent players, while most of the
plays in which they appeared are not only no
longer actable, but also no longer readable. The
brothers de Goncourt, for example, wrote an account
of Clairon which is a book of the first interest,
while I defy any one to get through two
pages of most of the fustian she was compelled to
act! The reason for this is very easily formulated.
Great acting is human and universal. It
is eternal in its appeal and its memory is easily
kept alive while playwrighting is largely a matter
of fashion, and appeals to the mob of men and
women who never read and who are more interested
in police news than they are in poetry. George
Broadhurst or Henry Bernstein or Arthur Wing
Pinero, or others like them, have always been the
popular playwrights; a few names like Sophocles,
Terence, Moli&egrave;re, Shakespeare, and Ibsen come
rolling down to us, but they are precious and few.</p>

<p>A great actor, indeed, can put life into perfectly
wooden material. In the case of Sarah
Bernhardt, who was the creator, the actress or
Sardou? In the case of Henry Irving, who was
the creator, the actor or the authors of <i>The Bells</i>
and <i>Faust</i> (not, in this instance, Goethe)? Is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Langdon Mitchell's version of "Vanity Fair" sufficiently
a work of art to exist without the co-operation
of Mrs. Fiske? When Duse electrified
her audiences in such plays as <i>The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray</i> and <i>Fedora</i>, were the dramatists responsible
for the effect? Arthur Symons says
of her in the latter play, "A great actress, who is
also a great intelligence, is seen accepting it, for
its purpose, with contempt, as a thing to exercise
her technical skill upon." One reads of Mrs. Siddone
that she could move a roomful of people to
tears merely by repeating the word "hippopotamus"
with varying stress. Should we thank the
behemoth for this miracle?</p>

<p>Any one who understands, great acting knows
that it is illumination. There are those who are
born to throw light on the creations of the poets,
just as there are others born to be poets. These
interpreters give a new life to the works of the
masters, &AElig;schylus, Congreve, Tchekhov. When,
as more frequently happens, they are called upon
to play mediocre parts it is with their own personal
force, their atmospheric aura that they
create something more than the author himself
ever intended or dreamed of. How could Joseph
Jefferson play <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> for thirty years
(or longer) with scenery in tatters and a company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
of mummers which Corse Payton would have
scorned? Was it because of the greatness of the
play? If that were true, why is not some one else
performing this drama today to large audiences?
Has any one read the Joseph Jefferson acting
version of <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>? Who wrote it?
Don't you think it rather extraordinary that a
play which apparently has given so much pleasure,
and in which Jefferson was hailed as a great actor
by every contemporary critic of note, as is in itself
so little known? It is not extraordinary.
It was Jefferson's performance of the title r&ocirc;le
which gave vitality to the play.</p>

<p>Of course, there are few actors who have this
power, few great actors. What else could you
expect? A critic might prove that playwriting
was not an art on the majority of the evidence.
Almost all the music composed in America could
be piled up to prove that music was not an art.
Should we say that there is no art of painting because
the Germans have no great painters?</p>

<p>At present, however, it is quite possible for any
one in New York with car or taxi-cab fare to see
one of the greatest of living actresses. She is not
playing on Broadway. This actress has never been
to dramatic school; she has not had the advantages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
of Alla Nazimova, who has worked with at least
one fine stage director. She was simply born a
genius, that is all; she has perfected her art by
appearing in a great variety of parts, the method
of Edwin Booth. Most of these parts happen to
be in masterpieces of the drama. She is not unaccustomed
to playing <i>Zaza</i> one evening and
d'Annunzio's <i>Francesca da Rimini</i> the next. Her
repertory further includes <i>La Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias</i>,
<i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>La Figlia di Iorio</i>,
Giuseppe Giacosa's <i>Come le Foglie</i>, Sicilian folk-plays,
and plays by Arturo Giovannitti. When I
first saw Mimi Aguglia she was little more than a
crude force, a great struggling light, that sometimes
illuminated, nay often blinded, but which
shone in unequal flashes. Experience has made of
her an actress who is almost unfailing in her effect.
If you asked her about the technique of her art
she would probably smile (as Mozart and Schubert
might have done before her); if you asked her
about her method she would not understand you
... but she understands the art of acting.</p>

<p>Watch her, for instance, in the second act of
<i>Zaza</i>, in the scene in which the music hall singer
discovers that her lover has a wife and child. No
heroics, no shrieks, no conventional posturings and
shruggings and sobbing ... something far worse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
she exposes to us, a nameless terror. She stands
with her back against a table, nonchalant and
smilingly defiant, unwilling to return to the music
hall with her former partner, but pleasantly jocular
in her refusal. Stung into anger, he hurls his
last bomb. Zaza is smoking. As she listens to
the cruel words the corner of her mouth twitches,
the cigarette almost falls. That is all. There is
a moment's silence unbroken save by the heartbeats
of her spectators. Even the babies which
mothers bring in abundance to the Italian theatre
are quiet. With that esoteric magnetism with
which great artists are possessed she holds the audience
captive by this simple gesture. I could
continue to point out other astounding details
in this impersonation, but not one of them, perhaps,
would illustrate Aguglia's art as does this
one. If no training is necessary to produce effects
of this kind, I would pronounce acting the
most holy of the arts, for then, surely, it is a
direct gift from God.</p>

<p>I have a fine memory of a chance description
flung off by some one at a dinner in Paris; a
picture of the youthful Isadora Duncan in her
studio in New York developing her ideals through
sheer will and preserving the contour of her feet
by wearing carpet slippers. The latter detail
stuck in my memory. It may or may not be true,
but it could have been, <i>should</i> have been true. The
incipient dancer keeping her feet pure for her
coming marriage with her art is a subject for
philosophic dissertation or for poetry. There are
many poets who would have seized on this idea for
an ode or even a sonnet, had it occurred to them.
Oscar Wilde would have liked this excuse for a
poem ... even Robert Browning, who would
have woven many moral strophes from this text....
It would have furnished Mr. George Moore
with material for another story for the volume
called "Celibates." Walter Pater might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
dived into some very beautiful, but very conscious,
prose with this theme as a spring-board. Huysmans
would have found this suggestion sufficient
inspiration for a romance the length of "Clarissa
Harlowe." You will remember that the author of
"En Route" meditated writing a novel about a
man who left his house to go to his office. Perceiving
that his shoes have not been polished he
stops at a boot-black's and during the operation
he reviews his affairs. The problem was to make
300 pages of this!... Lombroso would have
added the detail to his long catalogue in "The Man
of Genius" as another proof of the insanity of artists.
Georges Feydeau would have found therein
enough matter for a three-act farce and d'Annunzio
for a poetic drama which he might have
dedicated to "Isadora of the beautiful feet." Sermons
might be preached from the text and many
painters would touch the subject with reverence.
Manet might have painted Isadora with one of the
carpet slippers half depending from a bare, rosy-white
foot.</p>

<p>There are many fables concerning the beginning
of Isadora's career. One has it that the original
dance in bare feet was an accident.... Isadora
was laving her feet in an upper chamber when her
hostess begged her to dance for her other guests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Just as she was she descended and met with such
approval that thenceforth her feet remained bare.
This is a pretty tale, but it has not the fine ring of
truth of the story of the carpet slippers. There
had been bare-foot dancers before Isadora; there
had been, I venture to say, discinct "Greek
dancers." Isadora's contribution to her art is
spiritual; it is her feeling for the idea of the dance
which isolates her from her contemporaries.
Many have overlooked this essential fact in attempting
to account for her obvious importance.
Her imitators (and has any other interpretative
artist ever had so many?) have purloined her costumes,
her gestures, her steps; they have put the
music of Beethoven and Schubert to new uses as
she had done before them; they have unbound their
hair and freed their feet; but the essence of her
art, the <i>spirit</i>, they have left in her keeping; they
could not well do otherwise.</p>

<p>Inspired perhaps by Greek phrases, by the
superb collection of Greek vases in the old Pinakotheck
in Munich, Isadora cast the knowledge
she had gleaned of the dancer's training from her.
At least she forced it to be subservient to her new
wishes. She flung aside her memory of the entrechat
and the pirouette, the studied technique of the
ballet; but in so doing she unveiled her own soul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
She called her art the renaissance of the Greek
ideal but there was something modern about it,
pagan though it might be in quality. Always it
was pure and sexless ... always abstract emotion
has guided her interpretations.</p>

<p>In the beginning she danced to the piano music
of Chopin and Schubert. Eleven years ago I saw
her in Munich in a program of Schubert <i>impromptus</i>
and Chopin <i>preludes</i> and <i>mazurkas</i>. A
year or two later she was dancing in Paris to the
accompaniment of the Colonne Orchestra, a good
deal of the music of Gluck's <i>Orfeo</i> and the very
lovely dances from <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Aulide</i>. In these
she remained faithful to her original ideal, the
beauty of abstract movement, the rhythm of exquisite
gesture. This was not sense echoing sound
but rather a very delightful confusion of her own
mood with that of the music.</p>

<p>So a new grace, a new freedom were added to the
dance; in her later representations she has added a
third quality, strength. Too, her immediate interpretations
often suggest concrete images....
A passionate patriotism for one of her adopted
countries is at the root of her fiery miming of
the <i>Marseillaise</i>, a patriotism apparently as
deep-rooted, certainly as inflaming, as that which
inspired Rachel in her recitation of this hymn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
during the Paris revolution of 1848. In times
of civil or international conflagration the dancer,
the actress often play important r&ocirc;les in world
politics. Malvina Cavalazzi, the Italian <i>ballerina</i>
who appeared at the Academy of Music during
the Eighties and who married Charles Mapleson,
son of the impressario, once told me of a part
she had played in the making of United Italy.
During the Austrian invasion the Italian flag was
<i>verboten</i>. One night, however, during a representation
of opera in a town the name of which I have
forgotten, Mme. Cavalazzi wore a costume of green
and white, while her male companion wore red, so
that in the <i>pas de deux</i> which concluded the ballet
they formed automatically a semblance of the
Italian banner. The audience was raised to a
hysterical pitch of enthusiasm and rushed from the
theatre in a violent mood, which resulted in an
immediate encounter with the Austrians and their
eventual expulsion from the city.</p>

<p>Isadora's pantomimic interpretation of the <i>Marseillaise</i>,
given in New York before the United
States had entered the world war, aroused as
vehement and excited an expression of enthusiasm
as it would be possible for an artist to awaken in
our theatre today. The audiences stood up and
scarcely restrained their impatience to cheer. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
the previous performances in Paris, I am told, the
effect approached the incredible.... In a robe
the colour of blood she stands enfolded; she sees
the enemy advance; she feels the enemy as it
grasps her by the throat; she kisses her flag; she
tastes blood; she is all but crushed under the
weight of the attack; and then she rises, triumphant,
with the terrible cry, <i>Aux armes, citoyens!</i>
Part of her effect is gained by gesture, part by the
massing of her body, but the greater part by
facial expression. In the anguished appeal she
does not make a sound, beyond that made by the
orchestra, but the hideous din of a hundred raucous
voices seems to ring in our ears. We see
F&eacute;licien Rops's <i>Vengeance</i> come to life; we see the
<i>sans-culottes</i> following the carts of the aristocrats
on the way to execution ... and finally
we see the superb calm, the majestic flowing
strength of the Victory of Samothrace.... At
times, legs, arms, a leg or an arm, the throat, or
the exposed breast assume an importance above
that of the rest of the mass, suggesting the unfinished
sculpture of Michael Angelo, an aposiopesis
which, of course, served as Rodin's inspiration.</p>

<p>In the <i>Marche Slav</i> of Tschaikovsky Isadora
symbolizes her conception of the Russian moujik
rising from slavery to freedom. With her hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
bound behind her back, groping, stumbling, head-bowed,
knees bent, she struggles forward, clad only
in a short red garment that barely covers her
thighs. With furtive glances of extreme despair
she peers above and ahead. When the strains of
<i>God Save the Czar</i> are first heard in the orchestra
she falls to her knees and you see the peasant
shuddering under the blows of the knout. The
picture is a tragic one, cumulative in its horrific
details. Finally comes the moment of release and
here Isadora makes one of her great effects. She
does not spread her arms apart with a wide gesture.
She brings them forward slowly and we
observe with horror that they have practically forgotten
how to move at all! They are crushed,
these hands, crushed and bleeding after their long
serfdom; they are not hands at all but claws,
broken, twisted piteous claws! The expression of
frightened, almost uncomprehending, joy with
which Isadora concludes the march is another
stroke of her vivid imaginative genius.</p>

<p>In her third number inspired by the Great War,
the <i>Marche Lorraine</i> of Louis Ganne, in which is
incorporated the celebrated <i>Chanson Lorraine</i>,
Isadora with her pupils, symbolizes the gaiety of
the martial spirit. It is the spirit of the cavalry
riding gaily with banners waving in the wind; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
infantry marching to an inspired tune. There is
nothing of the horror of war or revolution in this
picture ... only the brilliancy and dash of war
... the power and the glory!</p>

<p>Of late years Isadora has danced (in the conventional
meaning of the word) less and less.
Since her performance at Carnegie Hall several
years ago of the <i>Liebestod</i> from <i>Tristan</i>, which
Walter Damrosch hailed as an extremely interesting
experiment, she has attempted to express
something more than the joy of melody and
rhythm. Indeed on at least three occasions she
has danced a Requiem at the Metropolitan Opera
House.... If the new art at its best is not
dancing, neither is it wholly allied to the art of
pantomime. It would seem, indeed, that Isadora
is attempting to express something of the spirit of
sculpture, perhaps what Vachell Lindsay describes
as "moving sculpture." Her medium, of necessity,
is still rhythmic gesture, but its development
seems almost dream-like. More than the dance
this new art partakes of the fluid and unending
quality of music. Like any other new art it is
not to be understood at first and I confess in the
beginning it said nothing to me but eventually I
began to take pleasure in watching it. Now Isadora's
poetic and imaginative interpretation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
symphonic interlude from C&eacute;sar Franck's <i>Redemption</i>
is full of beauty and meaning to me and during
the whole course of its performance the interpreter
scarcely rises from her knees. The neck,
the throat, the shoulders, the head and arms are
her means of expression. I thought of Barbey
d'Aurevilly's phrase, "<i>Elle avait l'air de monter
vers Dieu les mains toutes pleines de bonnes
oeuvres.</i>"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Isadora's teaching has had its results but her influence
has been wider in other directions. Fokine
thanks her for the new Russian Ballet. She did
indeed free the Russians from the conventions of
the classic ballet and but for her it is doubtful
if we should have seen <i>Scheherazade</i> and <i>Cl&eacute;op&acirc;tre</i>.
<i>Daphnis et Chloe</i>, <i>Narcisse</i>, and <i>L'Apr&egrave;smidi
d'un Faune</i> bear her direct stamp. This
then, aside from her own appearances, has been
her great work. Of her celebrated school of dancing
I cannot speak with so much enthusiasm. The
defect in her method of teaching is her insistence
(consciously or unconsciously) on herself as a
model. The seven remaining girls of her school
dance delightfully. They are, in addition, young
and beautiful, but they are miniature Isadoras.
They add nothing to her style; they make the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
gestures; they take the same steps; they have almost,
if not quite, acquired a semblance of her
spirit. They vibrate with intention; they have
force; but constantly they suggest just what they
are ... imitations. When they dance alone they
often make a very charming but scarcely overpowering
effect. When they dance with Isadora they
are but a moving row of shadow shapes of Isadora
that come and go. Her own presence suffices to
make the effect they all make together.... I
have been told that when Isadora watches her girls
dance she often weeps, for then and then only she
can behold herself. One of the griefs of an actor
or a dancer is that he can never see himself. This
oversight of nature Isadora has to some extent
overcome.</p>

<p>Those who like to see pretty dancing, pretty
girls, pretty things in general will not find much
pleasure in contemplating the art of Isadora.
She is not pretty; her dancing is not pretty. She
has been cast in nobler mould and it is her pleasure
to climb higher mountains. Her gesture is
titanic; her mood generally one of imperious grandeur.
She has grown larger with the years&mdash;and
by this I mean something more than the physical
meaning of the word, for she is indeed heroic in
build. But this is the secret of her power and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
force. There is no suggestion of flabbiness about
her and so she can impart to us the soul of the
struggling moujik, the spirit of a nation, the figure
on the prow of a Greek bark.... And when
she interprets the <i>Marseillaise</i> she seems indeed to
feel the mighty moment.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<h2>Margaret Anglin Produces<br />
<i>As You Like It</i></h2>


<p>Of all the comedies of Shakespeare <i>As You
Like It</i> is the one which has attracted to
itself the most attention from actresses.
No feminine star but what at one time or another
has a desire to play Rosalind. Bernard Shaw
says, "Who ever failed or could fail as Rosalind?"
and I am inclined to think him right,
though opinions differ. It would seem, however,
that Rosalind is to the dramatic stage what Mimi
in <i>La Boh&egrave;me</i> is to the lyric, a r&ocirc;le in which a
maximum of effect can be gotten with a minimum
of effort.</p>

<p>Opinions differ however. Stung to fury by
Mrs. Kendal's playing of the part, George Moore
says somewhere, "Mrs. Kendal nurses children all
day and strives to play Rosalind at night. What
infatuation, what ridiculous endeavour! To realize
the beautiful woodland passion and the idea of
the transformation a woman must have sinned, for
only through sin may we learn the charm of innocence.
To play Rosalind a woman must have had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
more than one lover, and if she has been made to
wait in the rain and has been beaten she will have
done a great deal to qualify herself for the part."
Still another critic considers the r&ocirc;le a difficult one.
He says: "With the exception of Lady Macbeth
no woman in Shakespeare is so much in controversy
as Rosalind. The character is thought to
be almost unattainable. An ideal that is lofty but
at the same time vague seems to possess the Shakespeare
scholar, accompanied by the profound conviction
that it never can be fulfilled. Only a few
actresses have obtained recognition as Rosalind,
chief among them being Mrs. Pritchard, Peg Woffington,
Mrs. Dancer, Dora Jordan, Louisa Nesbitt,
Helen Faucit, Ellen Tree, Adelaide Neilson,
Mrs. Scott-Siddons and Miss Mary Anderson."</p>

<p>Of those who have recently played Rosalind perhaps
Mary Anderson, Ada Rehan, Henrietta Crosman
and Julia Marlowe will remain longest in the
memory, although Marie Wainwright, Mary Shaw,
Mrs. Langtry and Julia Neilson are among a long
list of those who have tried the part. Miss Rehan
appeared in the r&ocirc;le when Augustin Daly revived
the comedy at Daly's Theatre, December 17, 1889.
We are told that an effort was made in this production
to emphasize the buoyant gaiety of the
piece. The scenery displayed the woods embellished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
in a springtime green, and the acting did
away as much as possible with any of the underlying
melancholy which flows through the comedy.</p>

<p>William Winter frankly asserts&mdash;perhaps not
unwittingly giving a staggering blow to the art of
acting in so doing&mdash;that the reason Rosalind is
not more often embodied "in a competent and enthralling
manner is that her enchanting quality is
something that cannot be assumed&mdash;it must be
possessed; it must exist in the fibre of the individual,
and its expression will then be spontaneous.
Art can accomplish much, but it cannot supply the
inherent captivation that constitutes the puissance
of Rosalind. Miss Rehan possesses that quality,
and the method of her art was the fluent method of
natural grace."</p>

<p>Fie and a fig for Mr. Moore's theory about being
beaten and standing in the rain, implies Mr.
Winter!</p>

<p>To Mr. Winter I am also indebted for a description
of Mary Anderson in <i>As You Like It</i>: "Miss
Anderson, superbly handsome as Rosalind, indicated
that beneath her pretty swagger, nimble
satire and silver playfulness Rosalind is as earnest
of Juliet&mdash;though different in temperament and
mind&mdash;as fond as Viola and as constant as
Imogen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Marlowe's Rosalind, somewhat along the
same lines as Miss Anderson's, and Miss Crosman's,
a hoydenish, tomboy sort of creature, first
cousin to Mistress Nell and the young lady of <i>The
Amazons</i>, should be familiar to theatregoers of the
last two decades.</p>

<p>Last Monday evening Margaret Anglin exposed
her version of the comedy. As might have been
expected, it has met with some unfavourable criticism.
Preconceived notions of Rosalind are as
prevalent as preconceived notions of Hamlet.
And yet if <i>As You Like It</i> had been produced Monday
night as a "new fantastic comedy," just as
<i>Prunella</i> was, for instance, I am inclined to think
that everybody who dissented would have been at
Miss Anglin's charming heels.</p>

<p>The scenery has been given undue prominence
both by the management and by the writers for
the newspapers. Its most interesting feature is
the arrangement by which it is speedily changed
about. There were no long waits caused by the
settings of scenes during the acts. To say, however,
that it has anything to do with the art of
Gordon Craig is to speak nonsense. The scenes
are painted in much the same manner as that to
which we are accustomed and inured. There is a
certain haze over the trees, caused partially by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
tints and partially by the lighting, which produces
a rather charming effect, but the outlines of the
trees are quite definite; no impressionism here.</p>

<p>The acting is quite a different matter. <i>As You
Like It</i> is one of the most modern in spirit of the
Shakespeare plays. This air of modernity is still
further emphasized by the fact that the play, for
the most part, is written in prose. I feel certain
that Bernard Shaw derived part of his inspiration
for <i>Man and Superman</i> from <i>As You Like It</i>.
Only in Shakespeare's play Ann Whitefield (Rosalind)
pursues Octavius (Orlando) instead of
Jack Tanner. I am inclined to believe that
Shaw's psychology in this instance is the more
sound. It seems incredible that a girl so witty,
so beautiful, and so intelligent as Rosalind should
waste so much time on that sentimental, uncomprehending
creature known as Orlando. Every line
of Orlando should have sounded the knell of his
fate in her ears. However, it must be remembered
that Orlando was young and good-looking, and
that, at least in the play, men of the right stamp
seemed to be scarce. Of course, it is out of
Touchstone that Shaw has evolved his Jack Tanner.</p>

<p>Whether Miss Anglin had this idea in mind or
not when she produced the comedy I have no means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
of ascertaining. It is not essential to my point.
At least she has emphasized it, and she has done
the most intelligent stage directing that I have observed
in the performance of a Shakespeare play
for many a long season. There is consistency in
the acting. Rosalind, Jaques, Touchstone, Celia,
Oliver, the dukes, Charles, Sylvius, the whole lot,
in fact, are natural in method and manner. There
is no striving for the fantastic. Let that part of
the comedy take care of itself, undoubtedly suggested
Miss Anglin.</p>

<p>Jaques, finely portrayed by Fuller Mellish, delivers
that arrant bit of nonsense "The Seven
Ages of Man" in such a manner as a man might
tell a rather serious story in a drawing room.
"The Seven Ages of Man," of course, is just
as much of an aria as <i>La Donna e Mobile</i>. It
always awakens applause, but this time the applause
was deserved. Mr. Mellish emphasized the
cynical side of the r&ocirc;le. He smiled in and out of
season, and his most "melancholy" remarks were
delivered in such a manner as to indicate that they
were not too deeply felt. Jaques was a little bored
with the forest and his companions, but he would
have been quite in his element at Mme. R&eacute;camier's.
Such was the impression that Fuller Mellish gave.
Bravo, Mr. Mellish, for an impression!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Similarly the Touchstone of Sidney Greenstreet.
We are accustomed to more physically attractive
Touchstones, fools with finer bodies, and yet this
keen-minded, stout person spoke his lines with such
pertness and spontaneity that they rarely failed of
their proper effect. As for Orlando, it seemed to
me that Pedro de Cordoba was a little too rhetorical
at times to fit in with the spirit of the performance,
but Orlando at times does not fit into
the play. For instance, when he utters those incredible
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If ever you have looked on better days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever been where bells have knolled to church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever sat at any good man's feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear...."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I do not know whether Miss Anglin is a disciple
of George Moore or William Winter in her acting
of Rosalind. How she acquired her charm is not
for us to seek into. It is only for us to credit her
with having it in great plenty. A charming natural
manner which made the masquerading lady
seem more than a fantasy. Her warning to Phebe,</p>

<p>
"Sell when you can; you are not for all markets,"<br />
</p>

<p>was delicious in its effect. I remember no Rosalind
who wooed her Orlando so delightfully. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Rosalind, as Woman the Pursuer, driven forward
by the Life Force, is convincingly Miss Anglin's
conception&mdash;a conception which fits the comedy
admirably.</p>

<p>As to the objections which have been raised to
Miss Anglin's assumption of the masculine garments
without any attempt at counterfeiting masculinity,
I would ask my reader, if she be a woman,
what she would do if she found it necessary to wear
men's clothes. If she were not an actress she
would undoubtedly behave much as she did in
women's, suppressing unnecessary and telltale gestures
as much as possible, but not trying to imitate
mannish gestures which would immediately
stamp her an impostor. There is no internal evidence
in Shakespeare's play to prove that Rosalind
was an actress. She might have appeared in private
theatricals at the palace, but even that is
doubtful. Consequently when she donned men's
clothes it became evident to her that many men
are effeminate in gesture and those that are do
not ordinarily affect mannish movements. Her
most obvious concealment was to be natural&mdash;quite
herself. This, I think, is one of the most interesting
and well-thought-out points of Miss
Anglin's interpretation.</p>
